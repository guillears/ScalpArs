## NEW ENTRIES (2026-06-02 onward — full text)

### 2026-06-03 — REVERTED `adx_dir_long` rising → both (LONG side was backwards; SHORT keeps rising)

**Change:** `adx_dir_long` "rising" → "both" in trading_config.json. `adx_dir_short` stays "rising".

**Why (error correction):** the Jun-2 ship set both sides to "rising" (block falling-pair-ADX = exhaustion). On the proper **7-batch proxy** (which has correctly-signed `adx_delta`: 59 of 222 falling), the LONG side is **backwards**:
- LONG FALLING-ADX (cut by rising): N=48, **50% WR, Avg +0.002** (breakeven) — the filter was removing these.
- LONG RISING-ADX (kept): N=72, **39% WR, Avg −0.174** — the filter was keeping the actual losers.
- SHORT FALLING (cut): N=11, 45% WR, **−0.239** (loser ✓); SHORT RISING (kept): N=91, **62% WR** ✓ — short side is correct, kept.

**Root cause:** the original LONG ship's "falling-ADX LONG = 1W/9L" evidence came from `dedupe_pool.csv` (full pool), whose `entry_adx_delta` is **broken** — only **6 negative of 558**, vs **59 of 222** in `dedupe_pool_7batches`. The two pool files compute/populate adx_delta inconsistently; the 7-batch file is the trustworthy one. So the LONG ship rested on a bad field. (Methodology flag: earlier cross-pool adx_delta comparisons were apples-to-oranges — trust the 7-batch file for adx_delta.)

**Net:** SHORT-side falling-ADX block retained (evidence-backed, −0.24 losers cut). LONG-side reverted to no-direction-filter. Caveat: 7-pool N=48/72, single pool; the "rising-LONG=loser" split may carry confounds, but the direction clearly contradicts the (broken-data) ship rationale, so revert is the defensible call.

### 2026-06-03 — SHIPPED: `no_trade_pairs` (track-only) mechanism — BTCUSDT visible but non-trading

**Change:** new config field `no_trade_pairs` (comma-separated, top-level, mirrors `pair_blacklist`) + `BTCUSDT` placed in it. **The distinction:**
- `pair_blacklist` → pair removed from the top-pair/volume universe entirely (not subscribed, scanned, or displayed). Applied at universe-fetch (`trading_engine.py:5433`).
- `no_trade_pairs` → pair STAYS in the universe (subscribed, scanned, **shown in Top-Pair-by-Volume**) but every LONG/SHORT signal is forced to NO_TRADE at the per-pair eval (`trading_engine.py:~5811`), counter `PAIR_NO_TRADE`.

**Why:** user wants BTCUSDT visible/tracked on the dashboard for reference but not trading (consistent with the edge<fee evidence — BTC shouldn't open positions, but should stay in view). The blacklist removes it from sight; this keeps it visible while blocking entries. BTC's macro reference (regime/RSI/ADX/slope) was already fetched independently (`get_ohlcv('BTC/USDT:USDT')`), so this is purely about the *tradeable/displayed* universe.

**Full D11:** config.py (`no_trade_pairs: str = ""` + comment), trading_config.json (`"BTCUSDT"`), engine (per-pair entry block + PAIR_NO_TRADE counter), main.py ConfigUpdate field, UI (text input + helper text + load/save + summary line). Generic config-merge apply (model_dump) — no special handler needed, mirrors pair_blacklist. Verified: py+json syntax OK, input IDs wired (input=1, load+save). Could not runtime-test locally (pydantic_settings is deploy-only) — verify PAIR_NO_TRADE fires on BTC post-deploy.

**State note:** BTCUSDT is now in `no_trade_pairs`, NOT `pair_blacklist`, and NOT freely tradeable — a distinct third state. Supersedes the same-day "whitelisted BTC" entry (BTC is now track-only, not tradeable).

### 2026-06-03 — WHITELISTED BTCUSDT (user override; removed from blacklist same day it was added)

**Change:** removed `BTCUSDT` from `pair_blacklist` (now 10 pairs). Reverses the BTC blacklist shipped earlier today.

**Discipline note (override, flagged):** This is **against the evidence.** BTC was the single best-evidenced structural loser: N=27, 26% WR, −0.208% avg, −5.62% total, with the deciding mechanism being edge < fee (avg favorable excursion ~0.19% vs 0.077% roundtrip fee → no extractable edge after costs). Tight-exit and lower-TP simulations both failed to make it profitable. Shipped per explicit user direction as a deliberate override. Mitigants: (1) current filters block ~83% of BTC trades historically, so it should rarely fire; (2) the per-pair revert gate applies — re-blacklist at ≤35% WR on N≥10 fresh, which BTC's 26% historical WR is near-certain to trip if it trades meaningfully. **Watch BTC per-pair WR closely; expect to re-blacklist.**

**Blacklist now (10):** BNBUSDT, ENAUSDT, FILUSDT, MUSDT, RAVEUSDT, TRUMPUSDT, VVVUSDT, XAGUSDT, XAUUSDT, ZECUSDT. **Released total (13):** the 12 thin-N pairs + BTCUSDT.

### 2026-06-03 — TRIMMED pair_blacklist 23 → 11 (released 12 thin-evidence pairs for forward re-test)

**Change:** `pair_blacklist` reduced from 23 to 11 pairs.

**Why:** Audit of the 23 blacklisted pairs found only **5 had solid evidence** (N≥15 losers). The blacklist was built on **raw pre-filter performance, never re-simulated under the current 15+ filter stack** — and blacklisted pairs have NO post-blacklist data (they stopped trading), so the thin-evidence entries can't be validated from history. Twelve were blacklisted on N<15 (violating the locked "never ship from <N=15" discipline) — e.g. **LABUSDT on N=1**, **ADAUSDT at −0.033% (≈breakeven)**. The only honest way to re-evaluate is to release them and observe forward, now that the current filters gate entries.

**KEPT BLACKLISTED (11):**
- Evidenced losers (N≥15): `BTCUSDT` (27/26%/−5.62), `FILUSDT` (31/55%/−3.36), `VVVUSDT` (17/41%/−4.40), `BNBUSDT` (16/38%/−2.20), `TRUMPUSDT` (15/33%/−3.83).
- Commodities (different asset class, intentional): `XAGUSDT`, `XAUUSDT`.
- No-data / preemptive (new-listing/illiquid, likely also covered by new_listing/alpha_subtype filters): `ENAUSDT`, `MUSDT`, `RAVEUSDT`, `ZECUSDT`.

**RELEASED / WHITELISTED (12) — now tradeable again, under current filters:**
`ADAUSDT, ASTERUSDT, BCHUSDT, DOGEUSDT, ERAUSDT, HYPEUSDT, ICPUSDT, LABUSDT, LINKUSDT, PUMPUSDT, SKYAIUSDT, WLFIUSDT`. (All had N<15 pre-filter; full table: ADA 12/42%/−0.033, HYPE 13/38%/−0.173, LINK 13/31%/−0.175, WLFI 8/38%/−0.431, DOGE 6/0%/−0.743, BCH 6/33%/−0.250, ICP 6/17%/−0.421, PUMP 6/17%/−0.307, SKYAI 6/33%/−0.285, ASTER 4/25%/−0.104, ERA 3/33%/−0.304, LAB 1/0%/−1.192.)

**LOCKED REVERT GATE (per released pair):** re-blacklist any released pair that shows **≤35% WR on N≥10 fresh** (current-stack) trades. Track per-pair WR as fresh trades accumulate. This converts 12 overfit pre-filter blacklists into a controlled forward re-test.

**Caveat acknowledged:** releasing adds pairs whose *historical* (pre-filter) numbers look poor (DOGE 0%, ICP 17%, LAB −1.19) — but on N=1–6, those are noise, and the current filter stack should gate the bad entries. The revert gate is the safety net. This is a deliberate "trust the filters + re-test" move, not an assertion these pairs are good.

### 2026-06-03 — BLACKLISTED BTCUSDT (added to `pair_blacklist`)

**Change:** added `BTCUSDT` to `trading_config.json` `pair_blacklist` (now 23 pairs).

**Rationale (structural, not just a bad streak):** Across all configs (27 unique BTC trades, May 4–Jun 3): **26% WR, −0.208% avg, −5.62% total.** BTC LONG 17% WR (N=18), BTC SHORT 44% (N=9). The mechanism is the deciding factor: BTC's average favorable excursion is only **+0.19%**, barely above the **0.077% roundtrip fee** — there's essentially no extractable edge after costs. Expectancy decomposition (whole book) showed gross edge ≈ 0 and fees the deterministic drag; for BTC specifically the move size is too small to clear fees even with tight exits (simulated tp 0.08/SL −0.35 raised WR 28→56% but Σ stayed −3.77, because net win ≈ +0.01 after fee). Lower-TP "rescue" rejected: only 4/20 BTC losers are never-positive, but the 15 that go green peak at just +0.14% avg — a 0.15%-gross TP nets ~+0.08 and catches only 6, leaving it deeply negative. **BNBUSDT (BTC's only true low-vol peer, ATR 0.12) was already blacklisted** — this completes the low-vol-major set. BTC was already ~83% filter-blocked, so live impact is small.

**Scope note:** blacklisting BTCUSDT as a *tradeable pair* is independent of BTC as the *macro reference* — the engine computes BTC regime/RSI/ADX/EMA-slope separately, so all BTC-macro filters keep working. (Worth a one-time eyeball post-deploy, but the code paths are distinct.)

**Not blacklisted (considered, held):** SOLUSDT (36 trades, 31% WR, −7.58% — worse total than BTC) is a *different* problem — it has genuine runner edge (10 trades peaked ≥0.45%, 9 won) but 44% of its losers are never-positive (bad entries, likely LONG-side). A lower TP would *harm* SOL (caps its runners). Decision deferred pending a SOL LONG-vs-SHORT split — keep-short-only / entry-filter / blacklist TBD. Do NOT reflexively blacklist on pooled old-config data.

### 2026-06-03 — SHIPPED: BTC-Acceleration Chase Filter (STATEFUL evolution filter, LONG only)

**Change:** new STATEFUL entry filter. Blocks a LONG when the live BTC EMA20 slope (`_btc_ema20_slope_pct`) is **higher** than it was at the most recent LONG that actually opened within `evo_chase_window_min` (30) minutes = BTC has accelerated since the last entry = chasing a maturing move (late). First stateful filter in the stack: engine tracks `self._last_long_open_ts` + `self._last_long_open_btc_ema20_slope`, updated in `open_position()` on every LONG that opens (blocked LONGs never reach there, so the reference stays the last REAL entry; the 30-min window auto-expires a stale reference). Config: `evo_chase_filter_long_enabled=true`, `evo_chase_filter_short_enabled=false` (untested side, plumbed-off), `evo_chase_window_min=30`. Counter `BTC_ACCEL_CHASE_LONG`. Full D11: config.py, trading_config.json, engine (state init + filter check at ~6472 + open-hook at end of open_position), UI (toggle + window input + load/save + summary).

**Evidence (7-batch proxy = current-config; full pool = directional check only — older configs):**
- "BTC EMA20 slope improving vs last LONG (30min)" block cohort: **7-batch N=26, 30.8% WR, Σ-3.1% (net-losing); full pool N=83, 48.2%** (directional). Mechanism = mean-reversion: chasing BTC as it accelerates past your last entry = late, lagging-alt entry into the tail of a BTC thrust.
- Live confirmation: caught the **06-03 4-loss cluster 0/4** (blocked all 4 losers, kept both winners). On the **06-02 original 4-loss event** it caught 2/4 (plateau misses SUI/DOT — see method notes). So ~50-100% cluster coverage, ZERO winners cut in those batches.
- The signal is the user's "evolution vs last trade" idea, validated; it INVERTS the naive intuition (BTC "better" → worse) because it measures *chasing*, not absolute conditions.

**Window = 30 is load-bearing (do NOT shorten):** at 10/15min the block cohort is NET-POSITIVE (Σ +0.3/+0.5%) — it contains fat-tail winners, so blocking it HURTS expectancy despite improving WR (the inverse of the high-WR-net-losing trap). 30min is where the cohort flips net-negative (-3.1%). 60min slightly stronger (29%) but 30 is the locked choice.

**Method notes (tested + rejected refinements):** (1) "vs cluster baseline" (block if slope > min-since-cluster) catches all 4 on 06-02 but dilutes cross-batch (7-batch 41.5% WR, cuts 17 winners vs 8) — REJECTED, overfit. (2) Blocking "flat" (Δ≥0) too — REJECTED: flat = same 5m candle = ALL BTC metrics identical (43/43 flat-slope also flat-RSI), and the flat cohort is neutral-to-winning (full 60.7%), so blocking it cuts winners. RSI can't sub-split flat cases (same candle). (3) Cluster-rank cap (block Nth rapid entry) — REJECTED on proxy: cuts more winners (rank≥3 = 15 vs 8) for a weaker cohort (39.5% vs 30.8%). Evolution dominates.

**Discipline (below-gate STATEFUL ship, acknowledged):** 7-batch block cohort N=26 (<30 gate), Avg -0.12 (>-0.20 gate) — clears WR≤40 only. Shipped as a discipline-override: best-evidenced LONG signal of the session (consistent batch + 7-batch + full directional + mechanism + live cluster catch), regime-agnostic (relative comparison survives regime shifts), zero winners cut in-batch.

**LOCKED REVERT GATE:** revert `evo_chase_filter_long_enabled`→false if would-be-blocked LONGs show **≥45% WR on N≥10 fresh**, OR if BTC_ACCEL_CHASE_LONG blocks a **net-positive cohort (Σ%>0) on N≥15 fresh**. Re-confirm at next ≥30-trade checkpoint. SCOPE NOTE: cluster filter only — does not catch isolated losers (e.g. SUI dead-tape/UNMATCHED-2× type); different levers for those.

### 2026-06-03 — SHIPPED: BTC 1h Slope MIN floor (`btc_1h_slope_min_short = -0.60`; SHORT only)

**Change:** new config field `btc_1h_slope_min_{long,short}` (a FLOOR on BTC 1h EMA20 slope). Blocks an entry when `btc_1h_slope < min` — i.e. when the higher-TF slope is too steeply NEGATIVE = entering into a steep 1h crash = exhaustion/mean-reversion bounce. **`min_short = -0.60` (ACTIVE)**, `min_long = 0.0` (plumbed but DISABLED). Disable convention: `0 = off`, any negative value activates. Full D11 stack: config.py default + comment, trading_config.json, engine block (`services/trading_engine.py` ~6450, mirrors the existing MAX gate; runs only when signal still LONG/SHORT after the max gate), UI inputs ("Min BTC 1h Slope L/S"), load+save handlers, config-summary line, counter `BTC_1H_SLOPE_MIN_GATE` (auto-surfaces in Filter Blocks).

**Evidence:** BTC 1h Slope (signed) analysis on the 7-batch pool surfaced a SHORT loser tail below ~-0.60. Sorted steep-negative-1h SHORTs (pool 6 from 06-02 + 2 fresh post-reset 06-02 23:26): SEI -1.006→-1.01, XRP -0.829→-0.71, BTC -0.829→-0.69, JTO -0.620→-1.20 = **STEEP (<-0.60): 0W/4L, Avg -0.90**; MILD (-0.60..-0.40): TON/AAVE/AVAX win, SOL loses = 3W/1L, Avg +0.06. Clean break at -0.60 (empty gap between -0.491 win and -0.620 loss → threshold anchored on the shallowest confirmed loser, JTO -0.62, with buffer from nearest winner TON -0.49; -0.50 rejected as too close to the winning mild band). Mechanism: shorting the exhausted hole (entries showed BTC RSI ~31.6 oversold, range-position 4-20 near bottom). NOT caught by existing filters — these had RISING pair ADX (Pair-ADX-Dir passes) and BTC ADX 32.8 (outside the 24-30 SHORT kill-zone).

**Discipline (below-gate ship, acknowledged):** N=4 across only 2-3 *correlated* events (XRP+BTC same minute, BTC is one of them) — below the N≥30 / ≥6-fresh bar. Shipped as a recent-evidence bet (clean threshold + real mechanism + out-of-sample confirmation across 2 sessions + uncovered by current stack), with a tighter-than-standard revert gate.

**LOCKED REVERT GATE:** revert `btc_1h_slope_min_short`→0 if would-be-blocked (slope<-0.60) SHORTs show **≥50% WR on N≥6 fresh**, OR if BTC_1H_SLOPE_MIN_GATE blocks a would-be-WINNER SHORT on **3+ separate sessions**. Re-confirm at the next ≥30-trade checkpoint.

**LONG deliberately left OFF:** the LONG BTC-1h-slope loser zone is the FLAT band (-0.10..0%, N=60, ~28% WR, structural across 6 dates / distributed pairs) — the *opposite* shape (chop, not steepness). That needs a mid-band range filter, not a floor; not built here. The fresh SUI LONG (slope -0.60) that prompted the look sits in the `<-0.40` band that historically WINS (60% WR) — an outlier loss (its real drivers were dead-tape GV + UNMATCHED 2×), so it does NOT motivate a LONG slope floor.

### 2026-06-02 (evening) — SHIPPED: Pair ADX Direction filter `both` → `rising` (BOTH LONG + SHORT)

**Change:** `trading_config.json` `adx_dir_long` and `adx_dir_short` flipped `"both"` → `"rising"`. Blocks any entry where pair ADX ≤ prior ADX (falling pair ADX = decelerating/exhausting momentum). Config-only flip — full feature stack (engine block `services/trading_engine.py:5873-5891`, PAIR_ADX_DIR `_record_filter_block` counter, UI load/save, display) already existed; nothing code-side changed.

**Trigger — today's batch (scalpars_orders_paper 2026-06-02 20:22):** the last 4 LONGs all lost (ETH −0.69%, DOT −0.97%, SUI −0.83%, BTC −0.69%, STOP_LOSS). They were one correlated BTC-top event (opened 20:06–20:10, BTC itself one of them), all at BTC RSI ~55.6 rising / BTC ADX 23.4 falling, range-position ~91 (extended top), and **pair ADX falling hard (adx_delta −1.3 to −1.7)**. Peak ~0.41% (below the 0.45% trail-arm) → never got going. The 2 LONG winners (XLM, TON) entered 4–8 min earlier, lower in range (~78), BTC RSI 49.5 falling, and trended (peak ~0.70%). Differentiator = falling pair ADX (momentum exhaustion).

**Cross-batch evidence (6-batch pool `reports/dedupe_pool.csv`, 558 trades):**
- Falling-ADX (adx_delta<0) **LONGs**: pool N=4 WR 25% + today's 4 losers = **N=8, ~13% WR** (vs rising/flat-ADX LONGs N=286 WR 52%).
- Falling-ADX **SHORTs**: N=2, **WR 0%**, Avg −1.10% (vs rising/flat SHORTs N=266 WR 60%).
- Combined both sides: **1 win in 10**. Falling ADX is a direction-agnostic loser (exhaustion entry).
- Falling-ADX is rare by construction: only 6 of 558 pool entries (4 L / 2 S), and all 6 are from 06-02 — the book historically almost never entered on falling ADX.

**Discipline note (below-gate ship, acknowledged):** N=8 LONG / N=2 SHORT is below the locked N≥30 filter gate, and all fresh samples are same-day (06-02). This is shipped as a **re-activation**, not a fresh 1-sample filter — `rising` already had cross-batch support on May 28 (`[L1843]` REVERTED both→rising "falling-ADX bled both sides", later relaxed to `both` at `[L1882]`), and was already on the active watchlist (CURRENT_STATE falling-ADX blind-spot). Per the discipline-override rule it carries a tighter-than-standard revert gate.

**LOCKED REVERT GATE:** Revert a side to `both` if would-be-blocked (falling-ADX) entries on that side show **≥50% WR on N≥6 fresh**. Also: if the PAIR_ADX_DIR counter blocks **>15% of that side's attempts** (vs ~1% historical base rate), treat as a regime shift and re-examine (possible over-block). Watch PAIR_ADX_DIR counter in Filter Blocks.

**Expected behavior:** very low fire-rate (~1% of historical entries), asymmetric payoff — blocks a 1W/9L cohort. Main downside: occasionally clips a falling-ADX mean-reversion winner (e.g. ORDI +0.60% today) — 1 such winner vs 9 losers in-sample.

### 2026-06-04 — DEMOTED LONG Extension Multiplier (Ext0.4-0.6_L family) 2× → 1×

**Change:** `extension_multiplier_rules` — all 3 LONG rules (`Ext0.4-0.6_L`, `Ext_QuietVol_L`, `Ext_SlowADX_L`) `inv_mult` 2.0 → **1.0** (lev_mult already 1.0). Tags KEPT (rules still fire and label `EXT_*` for tracking) — only the sizing is neutralized. config.py comment + trading_config.json + CURRENT_STATE updated. No engine/UI change (UI uses generic load/save rules editor; runtime reads inv_mult live).

**Trigger:** 2026-06-04 batch (12:10 report). RENDERUSDT LONG closed **−$171.87** — a 2×-multiplied extension cell (`EXT_Ext0.4-0.6_L+Ext_QuietVol_L+Ext_SlowADX_L`). At 1× this is ~−$86. Forensic: late entry (rngPos 83%, +0.53% above EMA13) into a fading move (ADX falling, adxΔ −0.64), BTC RSI falling 5m+30m, BTC 1h slope −0.57; peaked only +0.32%, never armed trailing, EMA13-cross exit saved it from a −3.96% post-exit crater. The multiplier doubled a no-edge late long.

**Cross-batch evidence (FULL pool, deduped, CLOSED, per-cell):**
- `Ext0.4-0.6_L` (base): N=5, WR 40%, Avg −0.216%, Tot **−$235** → ✗ HARMFUL (Total$<0, N≥5)
- `Ext0.4-0.6_L + QuietVol`: N=5, WR 40%, Avg −0.352%, Tot **−$252** → ✗ HARMFUL
- `Ext0.4-0.6_L + SlowADX`: N=3, +$21 → ⚠ low-N noise (positive but below 5)
- Whole LONG-2× class context: 7POOL N=27 −0.194% −$788 · FULL N=131 −0.174% −$3360 (long side carries no gross edge; amplifying it is structurally backwards). Most other harmful pooled LONG-2× cells (`PAIR_60-65_15-18` −$561, `STRETCH_*`) were ALREADY at 1× in current config (`rsi_adx_multiplier_long` empty) — historical, moot. The extension family was the only still-active harmful LONG 2×.

**Verdict basis:** Locked multiplier-cell rule — "✗ HARMFUL (Total$ negative on N≥5) → revert to 1.0×." Base + QuietVol both qualify. Conservative direction (2×→1× on a no-edge losing cohort cuts loss/variance, never amplifies), so the borderline N (=5, at the gate) is acceptable. "Caps for losers, multipliers for winners" — never multiply a side with no edge.

**LOCKED REVERT GATE:** RESTORE 2× only if `Ext0.4-0.6_L` reaches **N≥15 fresh (current-stack) AND Total$ > 0** in the Extension Multiplier Performance table. Until then it fires at 1.0× but stays tagged, so the cohort's true 1× edge is observable.

**Method note (per-batch vs pool):** In the 2026-06-04 batch itself the LONG 2× looked fine (+~$24 net — RENDER −172 offset by SKYAI +158 / HYPE +38, both 2×). Damage is only visible cross-batch — reaffirms core principle: judge multipliers on the pool, never a single batch.

### 2026-06-04 — WATCHLIST gate: C1+C6 SHORT toxic-combo (observation only, NOT shipped)

**Context:** Investigating the 2026-06-04 batch Pattern-C tables + cross-batch. Initial pass conflated "any C6 SHORT" (N=27, −$802) with a C6 problem. Re-run by **C-signature (UI Pattern-C Combination Tracker convention — group by which C's fire, W ignored)** on the 7-batch pool (BE-off proxy) corrected it:

- **C6 SHORT (C6 the only C):** N=24, 67% WR, Avg +0.011%, **−$135**, NP 8% → ≈flat, high-WR, NOT a loser cohort.
- **C1+C6 SHORT:** N=3, **0W/3L**, Avg −0.693%, **−$667**, NP 67% → the real bleed. Mechanism: C1 (capitulation chase) + C6 (macro over-extended) co-occur = shorting an over-extended capitulation that bounces. BOTH are multiplied cells (C1 = 3× eff), so the fat-tail losses are amplified (JTO −$320, SOL −$240, TON −$232 in the C6 audit were all 2× and mostly C1+C6 / C6+W stacks).
- For reference, LONG worst C-signatures same pool: C7 N=5 20% WR −$245 (countertrend bad-long), C4 N=12 42% −$314.

**Method note (definition mismatch that triggered this):** I had been computing "Cx alone" as *Cx only-C AND no W at all*, which gave C6-SHORT-alone = 0 and contradicted the UI (where TON shows under "C6" because the tracker groups by C-signature and ignores W). Corrected to the UI convention. Lesson logged: **match the UI's grouping convention when the user is reading off the UI.**

**Status:** WATCHLIST — N=3 ≪ N≥30 ship gate (and ≪ the ≥6 needed to act on a multiplier verdict). Direction-consistent (0/3 across 3 dates) so it clears the watchlist bar, not the ship bar. No config change.

**LOCKED GATE:** Cap effective multiplier to **1.0× on C1+C6 SHORT** if the combo holds **≤30% WR on N≥6 fresh** (current-stack). Track via the Pattern-C Combination Tracker row "C1+C6 SHORT". Until then, do nothing — C6 alone is fine and must not be blocked.

---

### 2026-06-04 — WATCHLIST gate: C7 LONG-alone / no-W (observation only, NOT shipped)

**Finding:** C7 = "Pair Countertrend Bounce." A LONG on a countertrend bounce with NO W (trend) confirmation = buying a dead-cat bounce / falling knife. Recent BE-off data (7-batch pool + 2026-06-04 batch, deduped):

- **C7 LONG with no W: N=3, 0W/3L, ≈−$265** — 1000LUNC (−$130, SL), ONDO (−$15, EMA13 cross), HOME (−$121, SL, this batch). 3 separate dates (May 28 / May 30 / Jun 4) → direction-consistent, not a single fat tail.
- Cross-ref (UI C-signature convention, W ignored): "C7" LONG row = N=5, 20% WR, −$245. The 2 extra are C7-with-W (trend-confirmed) and should NOT be blocked.
- Mechanism match: HOME was the batch's "textbook bad-long" (pairGap −1.44% countertrend, +0.90% over EMA13, BTC 1h −1.00); C7-alone *is* that bad-long isolated as a signature.

**Definition note:** block target = **C7-match AND `entry_pattern_w_any_match`=False** (countertrend long lacking trend confirmation). Distinct from the UI "C7" row, which groups by C-signature and ignores W (hence N=5 not N=3). Stated explicitly to avoid the alone-vs-C-signature confusion from earlier this session.

**Status:** WATCHLIST — N=3 ≪ N≥30 ship gate; clears the ≥3-sample direction-consistent watchlist bar only. C7 LONG is observation-only (no multiplier), so the only lever is an entry filter. No config change.

**LOCKED GATE:** Ship a LONG entry-block on "C7-match AND w_any=False" only if the cohort holds **≤30% WR on N≥8 fresh** (current stack). Would have blocked HOME this batch — but one batch is not enough.

---

### 2026-06-04 — OBSERVATION-tracking added: C6 LONG (NOT a loser — do not block)

**Request:** track C6 LONG in detail. **Finding (recent 7-batch pool + 2026-06-04 batch, BE-off, deduped):**
- C6 LONG (all with C6 match): **N=7, 4W/3L, 57% WR, Avg ≈−0.002% (flat), Tot −$46.6, de-multiplied +$18.9 (positive), NP 14%.**
- By C-signature: C6 (only-C) N=6 50% −$85 (1×: −$19.5); C6+C7 N=1 +$38 (PORTAL).
- By W: **C6 LONG always fires no-W (N=0 with W)** — macro-over-extended longs carry no trend confirmation, yet still win 57% and are de-mux positive.
- Trades: RENDER −172 (2×), FET −117 (2×), HOME −28 (1×), INJ +36 (1×), SWARMS +38 (1×), PORTAL +38 (1×), SKYAI +158 (2×). The −$46.6 as-sized is ENTIRELY the 2× amplification on RENDER+FET; RENDER's 2× = the extension multiplier demoted earlier today, so the main amplifier is already handled.

**Verdict:** C6 LONG is NOT a loser cohort. Flat-to-positive, 57% WR, de-mux positive. No cap, no block — blocking would mislabel a breakeven cohort (high-WR-net-losing trap is about *sizing*, and the sizing culprit is already demoted). Observation-tracking only.

**WATCH-FOR-DETERIORATION GATE:** revisit (consider cap/block) only if C6 LONG turns net-negative **DE-MULTIPLIED** with **≤35% WR on N≥10 fresh**. Track the Pattern-C Combination Tracker "C6 LONG" row.

---

### 2026-06-04 — DISABLED BTC-Accel Chase Filter (LONG) — A/B test, C-levels hypothesis

**Change:** `evo_chase_filter_long_enabled` true → **false** (trading_config.json). config.py default was already False; `evo_chase_window_min=30` retained for if re-enabled. Counter BTC_ACCEL_CHASE_LONG will read 0 while off.

**Rationale (operator-directed):** Hypothesis that the LONG-side bleed is driven by **C-pattern levels (C4 low-vol chop, C6 macro-over-extended, C7 countertrend-bounce), NOT by BTC-chasing.** The BTC-Accel Chase filter was a below-gate Jun-3 ship (N=26, 30.8% WR proxy). Turning it OFF isolates the variable: with chase-blocking removed, if the LONG losers still cluster on C-levels, the C-level filters (C7-no-W block, C1+C6 cap, C6-LONG watch) are the real lever and the chase filter was noise.

**RE-ENABLE / KEEP-OFF GATE:** Track LONGs that the chase filter WOULD have blocked (live BTC EMA20 slope > slope at last LONG within 30min) now that they can open:
- ≤35% WR on N≥10 fresh → chase signal is real → RE-ENABLE.
- ≥50% WR on N≥10 fresh → chase was a false signal → KEEP OFF, pursue C-level filters instead.
Re-evaluate at next ≥30-trade checkpoint.

**Note:** one change at a time for clean attribution — this is the only live toggle this step; the C-level items remain observation-only watchlist until their own gates trip.

---

### 2026-06-04 — REDEFINED C1+C6 gate → full C1 SHORT combination review (incl. W)

**Change:** the Jun-4 "C1+C6 SHORT cap" watchlist gate is broadened to a **full C1 SHORT combination review** carried into the next batch, tracking **C+W signatures** (not just C), with de-mux 1× alongside as-sized. Two refinements vs the original:
1. **cap → BLOCK ENTRY** for C1+C6 — de-multiplied it still loses (−$333, 0% WR, 2 NP), so the entry is bad, not merely over-sized; a cap would only lose less.
2. **W dimension added** and shown not to matter — C6 is the clean driver.

**7-pool baseline (BE-off, beW=0):**
- C1+C6: N=3, 0W/3L, −$667 (de-mux −$333), 2 NP → TOXIC (loses under W1 / W1+W2 / W1+W2+W6 alike).
- C1-only N=9 78% +$48 · C1+C3 N=2 100% +$202 · C1+C2 N=2 100% +$441 → all winners (win under every W overlay).
- Cross-tab: **C1·has-C6 = 0% WR / −$667 vs C1·no-C6 = 85% WR / +$691** (razor-clean). C1·has-W2 78% vs C1·no-W2 57% (muddy, and its negativity is C6-contaminated — 2/3 C1+C6 losers carry W2). ⇒ block target = **C1+C6, W-agnostic**.
- C1-alone (only C1, no W): N=1 BE-off (MMTUSDT −$182); historically BE-inflated (91% WR = breakeven/fast-exit locks) → unreliable, do not act.

**GATES (observation only):** (1) C1+C6 SHORT → BLOCK ENTRY if ≤30% WR on N≥6 fresh. (2) Any winner C1 combo flips net-negative on N≥5 fresh → review/demote its multiplier. Next batch: report the full C+W C1 table.

---

### 2026-06-04 — OBSERVATION added: W2 LONG + W3 LONG/SHORT (next-batch tracking)

**W2 LONG (NOT a winner — W2 value is short-side only):**
- 7-pool: SHORT N=55, 76% WR, +0.109%, **+$634** (multiplied 3× eff, winning — keep). LONG N=14, 36% WR, −0.048%, **−$47** (baseline 1×, ≈breakeven).
- 2026-06-04 batch: SHORT N=4, 75% WR, +$718. LONG N=5, **0W/5L, −0.673%, −$337, 4 NP (DOA)**.
- W2-long losers this batch (AAVE/SOL/XRP/1000PEPE) overlap the C6/Neither DOA bleed → regime, not a standalone W2-long signal. W2-LONG is 1× (not multiplied), so the only lever is an entry block.
- **GATE:** consider a LONG entry-block on W2 only if ≤35% WR on N≥10 fresh AND net-negative. Do NOT touch W2 SHORT.

**W3 LONG & SHORT (too thin — no verdict):**
- W3 = "Energetic volatility." LONG: 7-pool N=3 33% −$96, batch N=1 −$129 (XPL DOA). SHORT: 7-pool N=2 0% −$232, batch N=0.
- Mildly negative both directions but N=1–3 everywhere → no statistical weight.
- **NO gate. Accumulate to N≥8 per side before any verdict.** Track in Pattern-W Combination Tracker.

### 2026-06-05 — SHIP: 6-change stack (chase ON · ATR-split LONG · gvol-override removed · ETH no-trade) + pool rename 7→8

**Derived from the 6-05 batch autopsy** (60 closed Jun 3–5, 44L −$2,321 / 16S +$714). LONG side proven to have no durable edge; only entry-removal (chase) + cohort-correct exits/sizing help. Operator-directed ship, batch-derived (in-sample) — gates below carry the haircut.

**Shipped (all 6, D11-complete: config.py + trading_config.json + engine + UI + load/save):**
1. **Chase filter ON** (`evo_chase_filter_long_enabled=true`) — was OFF since Jun 4 A/B. Re-enabled: on the batch it blocks 13 longs, removing −$853 of realized loss (the only lever that removes losers). Stateful: blocks a LONG when live BTC EMA20 slope > slope at last LONG opened within 30min.
2. **ATR-LOW Fixed TP (LONG)** (`atr_low_fixed_tp_long_enabled=true`, ATR<1.1 → TP +0.25%). New engine exit `ATR_FIXED_TP L1` — a profit-LOCK (fires only on a green trade; never cuts a DOA loser). Low-ATR longs have no runners (batch: high-ATR reach trailing arm ~80% vs ~30%, all 6 RUNNER_TRAIL longs ATR≥1.0) → lock the pop. Wired into both post-exit-tracking whitelists (live reg 4238 + recovery 751) → appears as its own row in Post-Exit Regret Deep Dive.
3. **ATR-HIGH multiplier (LONG)** (`atr_high_mult_long_enabled=true`, ATR>1.1 → inv ×2.0). New `_lookup_atr_multiplier` dimensional candidate (max-wins, **pattern-blocked** so 2× stays off C-pattern/DOA high-ATR longs like INJ, hard-capped 2×). Note: near-neutral on the batch (doubles INJ/STO losers ≈ +$13 net) — operator accepted; tight revert gate.
4. *(Fast-exit 0.20%/5min — DROPPED.)* Operator chose fix-TP-only after I flagged FAST_EXIT/PATTERN_FIXED_TP are profit-LOCKS in the engine, not loss-cuts. The earlier "+$1,040 modeled" assumed fast-exit cut DOA longs — WRONG; corrected realistic batch ≈ breakeven, chase-driven.
5. **Remove gvol capitulation override (SHORT)** (`global_volume_max_short_capitulation_override_enabled=false`). New master toggle; when off, high-GV shorts always blocked regardless of BTC capitulation. **No-op unless `global_volume_max_short>0`** (cap currently disabled) — flagged in config + UI. $0 effect on this batch (no capitulation event Jun 3–5; the override's historical losers were May-27 / 7-pool).
6. **ETH → no-trade (track-only)** (`no_trade_pairs="BTCUSDT,ETHUSDT"`). ETH stays visible/scanned, entries blocked (counter PAIR_NO_TRADE). Evidence: ETH shorts −$230 this batch (3 trades, squeezed on the bounce) AND −$230 prior batch — recurring squeeze pair. Track-only (not blacklist) so the would-be record stays observable.

**Corrected expectation (stated to operator):** full stack ≈ breakeven on the batch (chase −$853 does the real work; exit caps reduce give-back on the few low-ATR winners; 2× ATR neutral; gvol-removal $0; ETH-track +$230). NOT the earlier +$1,040.

**REVERT GATES (locked):**
- **ATR-HIGH 2× LONG:** drop to 1.0× if Total$<0 on N≥5 fresh ATR>1.1 longs.
- **ATR-LOW Fixed TP:** watch the `ATR_FIXED_TP L1` row in Post-Exit Regret — if avg Post-Peak is high (cohort kept running after the cap), 0.25% is too tight → raise/disable. If Post-Peak ≈ 0, lock is correct.
- **Chase ON:** keep while would-be-blocked LONGs run ≤50% WR; the Jun-4 re-enable gate is now resolved (re-enabled).
- **gvol override removed:** re-enable only if would-be-passed capitulation shorts (high-GV + BTC RSI<30 & slope<0) show ≥55% WR on N≥6 fresh.
- **ETH no-trade:** revisit if ETH (either side) would-have-won ≥55% WR on N≥8 fresh while track-only.

**Pools:** added the 60 batch trades to the pool. **`dedupe_pool_7batches_may26-jun2.csv` (222) renamed → `dedupe_pool_8batches_may26-jun5.csv` (282, May26→Jun5, 164L/118S)** (batch aligned to the 196-col schema). `dedupe_pool_FULL.csv` rebuilt → 1,193 closed (Apr28→Jun5). Batch text report saved to `reports/batch_report_2026-06-05.txt`.

### 2026-06-05 — WATCHLIST (NOT shipped): BTC RSI×ADX Cross-Filter simplification

**Proposal (queued for next-batch review, operator-directed hold):**
1. **Delete dead rule 3** — `RSI 60-65 × ADX 27-30`. First-match-wins by RSI band means rule 2 (`60-65 × 22-25`) claims the 60-65 band first, so rule 3 never evaluates. Pure dead config. (Side note: the cell it *intended* to allow, 60-65×27-30, is actually a decent FULL-pool cell — N=14/79% WR/+$78 — but that's contaminated/thin, not a re-open trigger.)
2. **Replace the 5 RSI×ADX rules with two RSI-only blocks** (drop the ADX axis entirely):
   - `RSI 50-55 → block`
   - `RSI 60-100 → block`
   - Net effective LONG surface: allowed = **RSI 40-50 + 55-60** (all ADX 18-40); blocked = 50-55 & ≥60.

**Why drop ADX:** it does not separate within any RSI band — every ADX slice of a band carries the band's sign:
- RSI 50-55: ADX 18-25 −$394 / 25-32 −$551 / 32-40 −$196 (all negative).
- RSI 65-70: ADX 18-25 −$1,564 / 25-32 −$1,251 / 32-40 −$829 (all negative).
The per-ADX carve-outs (rules 2 & 4) are fitting noise.

**Theoretical critique:** the filter triangulates "good BTC regime for longs" from BTC RSI (momentum *level*) × BTC ADX (trend *strength*) — neither encodes BTC *direction*, which is what a long needs. Hence it barely separates (blocked −0.194 vs allowed −0.174). It is also internally inconsistent: it blocks ≥70 (overbought) but ALLOWS 65-70 — the same "long into BTC near-exhaustion" mechanism one notch earlier, and the biggest LONG loser.

**Band sign-consistency (FULL pool vs last-4-batch):**
- 40-50: +$293 / +$61 → **+ both** (the only consistent winner; tiny N — longs rarely fire <50 BTC RSI).
- 50-55: −$1,141 / −$450 → **− both** (keep blocked).
- 55-60: −$733 / +$524 → **FLIPS** (non-stationary — allow as least-bad firing band, do NOT bank).
- 60-65: −$1,976 / −$745 → **− both** (currently only sliver-blocked → block fully).
- 65-70: −$3,644 (N=184) / −$1,643 (N=48) → **− both, biggest loser, currently WIDE OPEN** ← the hole.
- ≥70: −$168 / — → − (already blocked).

**Last-4-batch impact (as-traded):** current surface allows 115 longs / −$1,860; new surface allows 26 / +$585. **Kills 89 longs (77%)** — all from 60-65 (41 / −$802) + 65-70 (48 / −$1,643) = **−$2,445 of loss removed**. 0 measurable adds (the 55-60-full opening has no historical trades — those cells were live-blocked; forward-only). The surviving +$585 rides the non-stationary 55-60 streak → NOT durable; the durable piece is the −$2,445 of 60-70 losers.

**Caveats:** big volume cut (77% of longs) ≈ near-shutdown of longs in the BTC-mid-RSI regime; losses partly overlap with chase + ATR-low fix-TP already live (incremental benefit < raw −$2,445); 55-60 non-stationary; FULL pool BE-on-contaminated (recent confirms the 65-70 finding, which is the load-bearing one).

**SHIP GATE (next batch):** ship the `60-100 → block` simplification IF 60-65 AND 65-70 longs are net-negative AGAIN (3rd-window confirmation of the both-window pattern). Delete rule 3 anytime (zero-risk cleanup). **Post-ship revert:** re-open 60-65 if would-be-blocked 60-65 longs show ≥50% WR on N≥10 fresh. Keep 55-60 allowed regardless (least-bad firing band) but treat its P&L as noise.

### 2026-06-06 — SHIP: SLWide widen `signal_active_sl` −0.70 → −1.00 (STOP_LOSS_WIDE only)

**Change:** `confidence_levels.{VERY_STRONG,STRONG_BUY}.signal_active_sl` −0.70 → **−1.00**. `stop_loss` kept −0.70. Lower confidence levels (−0.35) untouched (they barely trade).

**Level chosen from a sweep (the first counterfactual used −1.20; corrected here).** Modeling the real `signal_active_sl`×ATR-widen(×1.5)×−1.20-floor interaction (signal_active_sl only bites for ATR<0.60 — above that the ATR-widen already exceeds it): NET Δ is **monotonic to −1.20 (EV-max)** — 9-pool: −0.90 +$861 · −1.00 +$939 · −1.10 +$1,459 · −1.20 +$1,532; last-4+06-06: −0.90 +$1,044 · −1.00 +$1,149 · −1.20 +$2,020. Past −0.90 the marginal survivors troughed −1.0/−1.1% (proxy-soft recovery) and the deepening tail grows + is leveraged (2-3× cells). **Operator chose −1.00 (middle): ~60% of −1.20 EV, short of the deepest-trough trades.** −1.20 stage-up watchlisted for next batch.

**Mechanism (engine trading_engine.py:7551-7612):** `effective_sl` defaults to `stop_loss`; when the entry signal is STILL active at the stop, it's overridden to `signal_active_sl`. ATR-widen (×1.5) + floor (−1.20) are applied to whichever base, THEN the label is set: signal-active → **STOP_LOSS_WIDE**, signal-dead → **STOP_LOSS**. So `signal_active_sl` moves ONLY STOP_LOSS_WIDE; `stop_loss` governs STOP_LOSS. They were both −0.70 (identical fire level) until now. This is the dedicated lever to widen the signal-active stop independently.

**Thesis:** STOP_LOSS_WIDE = "stopped while the setup was still valid" — the reversal/regret population. Give it +0.20% more room so a wick/pullback within a still-valid signal doesn't kill the trade before it plays out. Signal-DEAD stops (STOP_LOSS) stay tight — those are correct exits (thesis gone, nothing to ride).

**Evidence (widen-to-−1.20 counterfactual, fix-TP applied to lo-ATR long survivors):**
- 8-pool (May26-Jun5): STOP_LOSS_WIDE N=56, −$6,554 → Δ **+$434** (survive 19 +$1,537 / deepen 35 −$1,103). Reverse rate 28%.
- last-4-batch (May29-Jun5): N=41, −$4,643 → Δ **+$922** (survive 18 +$1,464 / deepen 23 −$542, 2.7:1). Reverse rate 32%.
- Positive in BOTH windows (sign robust); magnitude regime-dependent (bigger in choppy-bounce, smaller in trend-crash because deepeners grow — May26-28 crash days shrink the 8-pool figure). After in-sample haircut ≈ +$250 (8-pool) to +$500 (last-4).
- Direction: last-4 SHORT Δ+$591 (9 save / 8 deepen) > LONG Δ+$331 (9 save / 15 deepen) — both positive.

**Lever choice — base SL, NOT the ATR multiplier:** the reversers are LOW-ATR (DOGE/WLFI/UNI, ATR<0.5) → ATR×1.5 < 0.70, so the ATR-widen never engages for them and they stop at the −0.70 base. Raising `sl_atr_multiplier` barely moves them; raising the base `signal_active_sl` widens them directly. ATR mult stays 1.5 (it's for high-ATR pairs, already handled).

**Caveats:** (1) widens into the LEVERAGED tail — the 35 (8-pool) deepeners are 2-3× cells too. (2) Regime-fragile in magnitude (not sign): a severe cascade could grow the deepen side. (3) Symmetric L/S — current SL config is per-confidence, not per-direction; split into `_long`/`_short` only if data diverges.

**REVERT GATE:** revert `signal_active_sl`→−0.70 if (a) STOP_LOSS_WIDE survive-vs-deepen goes net-negative over N≥30 fresh, OR (b) a single correlated-crash window adds ≥−$300 of deepened STOP_LOSS_WIDE loss vs the −0.70 baseline. Drawdown-tied, not just net-$, because the risk is the leveraged crash tail.

**Pools/report:** saved `reports/orders_2026-06-06_13L_10S.csv`; `dedupe_pool_8batches_may26-jun5.csv` (282) renamed → `dedupe_pool_9batches_may26-jun6.csv` (305, May26→Jun6, 177L/128S); `dedupe_pool_FULL.csv` rebuilt → 1,216 closed (Apr28→Jun6); batch report template `reports/batch_report_2026-06-06.txt`. Operator will reset and start a fresh batch on this config.

### 2026-06-06 — EXPERIMENT: BTC RSI×ADX Cross-Filter OFF (both sides, ~24h open run)

**Change:** blanked `btc_rsi_adx_filter_long` and `btc_rsi_adx_filter_short` (both → ""). Operator-directed time-boxed exploration. NOT a permanent removal.

**Archived for re-add (verbatim):**
- LONG: `70-100:40,60-65:22-25,60-65:27-30,55-60:20-25,50-55:99-100`
- SHORT: `30-35:30,35-40:20-26,45-50:25,0-30:25-30`
- (Pair-level `rsi_adx_filter_long`=`60-65:0-25` / `rsi_adx_filter_short`=`30-35:25,35-50:30` LEFT INTACT — different filter.)

**Rationale — break the measurement deadlock.** All session we've been blocked: the blocked-cell cohorts can't be validated because they're blocked (no recent data), and the historical pools are BE-on contaminated. The open BTC RSI×ADX simplification (ship `60-100→block` IF net-negative a 3rd window) is stuck for exactly this reason. A deliberate, time-boxed open run generates fresh current-stack per-band data on the LONG (50-55, 55-65, ≥70) and SHORT surfaces. Paper, so cost is bounded.

**Guardrails:** only the RSI×ADX surface opens — chase, ADX-delta, pair-ADX-dir, BTC-1h-slope, pair-level rsi_adx_filter, ADX [18,40] gate, quality score all STAY on (chase + ATR-low fix-TP still protect). Abort early if opened-band entries ≤30% WR on N≥20, or drawdown past comfort. **SHORT = the money-maker → tighter watch** (its cross-filter cells were validated winners historically; removing them is higher-risk than the no-edge LONG side — re-add SHORT immediately if the open short book degrades).

**Post-run analysis (pre-committed):** bucket fresh longs + shorts by BTC RSI band × ADX; re-add the cross-filter rules ONLY for bands confirming net-negative on fresh data; leave open any that surprise positive. Feeds the BTC RSI×ADX simplification watchlist directly. Judge on per-band breakdown, NOT the run P&L (LONG expected worse — the cost of the data).

**Attribution caveat:** stacks with the just-shipped SLWide −1.00 (entry-mix vs exit — separable but flagged).

**Addendum (same experiment):** also DISABLED the **Pair-Extension floor** via master toggle (`entry_dist_from_ema13_filter_enabled`→false; LONG min ext 0.20 value retained for one-flip re-enable). Same profile as the cross-filter — thin (N=9, same as ship), deadlocked (zero data since May 22), rare/tiny-save cohort, immaterial to LONG P&L (allowed longs lose −$5,669 vs this saving $237). The <0.20 band IS the worst-per-trade extension (−0.304% / 22% WR), so expect those longs to lose — the point is fresh data on whether bottom-of-pullback longs still die under the current stack. Post-run: re-enable the toggle if ext<0.20 confirms loser; leave off if it surprises. (Toggle disables both directions; SHORT was already 0.)

---

### 2026-06-06 — DISABLE: Runner Stretch-Trail exit (`runner_trail_enabled`→false); + UI toggle added

**Change:** `runner_trail_enabled` true → false. High-ATR LONG runners now exit via normal tight trailing (the stretch-trail handoff no longer fires). Also added a UI control row (toggle + atr_min/arm_peak/k) — none existed before; flippable from the dashboard now.

**Evidence (Runner Trail Performance table, all 6 live RUNNER_TRAIL exits since the Jun-1 ship):** net gain vs tight = **+$30** (3/6 beat tight = coin flip). The mechanism WON on the small "runners" (ORDI/SKYAI/RENDER, peaks 0.76-1.23) but LOST on the bigger ones (VIC −$15 / NEAR −$14 / PORTAL −$45) — those peaked 1.34-1.55% then FADED, and the stretch-trail gave back more than tight would have (PORTAL: peak +1.51 → exit +0.39, 26% of max; tight CF +0.84). Root cause: arms at peak≥0.70 which catches non-runners that fade; built for IDU-class monsters (peak >2-3%), none of which appeared in 6 fires. So it's a wash that quietly hurts the 1.0-1.5% peakers → disabled.

**Independence verified:** the high-ATR **2× ATR Multiplier** (`atr_multiplier_rules` "Runner", entry SIZING) is a SEPARATE code path (`_lookup_atr_multiplier` at entry) and does NOT reference `runner_trail_enabled`; the exit (`indicators.py`) does NOT reference the sizing multiplier. Disabling the exit leaves the 2× sizing fully intact (operator confirmed intent: "keep the multiplier").

**Re-enable gate:** turn back on only if a true monster runner (peak >2-3%) appears where the stretch-trail clearly out-captures tight. UI toggle exposed for one-click flip. (Stacks with the open-filter run, but separable — high-ATR LONG runners are rare and the P&L impact is ~$0, so it won't muddy the entry-band read.)

---

### 2026-06-07 — SHIP (as measurement): EMA13-cross-LONG phantom-CF + per-direction toggle

**Change:** added per-direction gates `ema13_cross_exit_long_enabled` / `ema13_cross_exit_short_enabled` under the master `ema13_cross_exit_enabled`. Set **LONG=false, SHORT=true**. When a side is off, the EMA13 cross no longer closes — it records a **phantom** (`phantom_ema13_cross_pnl` / `_at`, NEW DB cols) of the would-have-exited pnl and the trade rides to its real exit.

**Why (overrides the Jun-7 model-rejection):** the 9-pool model said disabling EMA13-cross-LONG is net-negative (−$65 at SLWide −1.00; coin-flip 22/22; cross protects reversing longs from the wider stop). Operator's call: don't argue the model — **measure it live at zero blind risk** via the phantom CF. This is the bot's shadow/phantom pattern applied to the EMA13 cross, mirroring the 🛡️ EMA13 Strict-Mode table.

**Build (full D11 + DB):**
- config.py: 2 per-direction fields (default True).
- models.py + database.py auto-migrate: `phantom_ema13_cross_pnl` (Float) + `phantom_ema13_cross_at` (DateTime).
- trading_engine.py (7368): per-direction gate in the EMA13 cross block — `_e13_stack_confirms and not _e13_dir_enabled` → record phantom (first-fire only) + fall through (no close); `... and _e13_dir_enabled` → close as before.
- main.py: `_compute_ema13_cross_disabled_cf(orders)` (phantom vs actual per direction, verdict ★ DISABLE-wins / ⚠ KEEP-cross) + payload wire.
- templates/index.html: LONG/SHORT sub-toggles (load+save, IDs verified 3×) + 🔀 EMA13 Cross Disabled-Direction CF table + render.

**READ GATE:** at N≥20 fresh LONG phantom-fires — ⚠ KEEP (cross beats held, net-$ neg) → re-enable LONG; ★ DISABLE-wins (held beats cut) → keep off (model was wrong). Self-contained (phantom vs held per trade), so it answers the EMA13 question cleanly even amid the open-surface run.

**Caveat:** stacks a 3rd live change on the open run (open entry + SLWide −1.00 + EMA13-cross-LONG-off), but the CF is per-trade-isolated so attribution holds for this specific question. Modest expected cost (model −$65) bought with real data.

---

### 2026-06-08 — SHIP: Trailing Min-Profit Gate (`trailing_min_profit_to_fire = +0.10`)

**Change:** the price-drop trailing stop now fires only when its exit level `(peak_pnl − effective_pullback) ≥ +0.10%`. Below that it's SUPPRESSED — the trailing goes dormant (does NOT realize a loss/sub-min exit), the trade rides the hard SL, and the trailing RE-ARMS once the peak climbs enough to lock ≥ +0.10, then trails the new peak normally through L2/L3/… like any runner.

**Root cause:** the ATR-widened pullback (`max(0.25, ATR×0.5)` + 0.1/level) exceeds the peak on **high-ATR L1** trades that barely arm. E.g. VELVET peak +0.45, ATR 1.33 → pullback 0.67 → trailing level 0.45−0.67 = **−0.22** → it exited RED on a pair that then ran to **+6.15%**. All 5 negative trailing exits (9-pool+batch) were this exact pattern: L1 + ATR 0.97-1.71 + pullback > peak.

**Evidence (9-pool + 06-08 batch):** the 16 trailing trades whose stop sat <+0.10 (the whipsaw zone) **all 16 recovered to ≥+0.25% after being cut**. Counterfactual (suppress + ride, with re-armed trailing / fix-TP / SLWide −1.00): **current +$190 → +$1,697 (Δ +$1,506)**. Big recoverers (VELVET −$24→+$645, HOME −$28→+$281, WLD +$90→+$307, XLM +$45→+$228, NEAR +$7→+$176) dwarf the few that ride to SL (NFP +$56→−$134, SEI, RENDER). In-sample → ~40% haircut → still ~+$900. Structural (a trailing stop shouldn't realize a loss), not curve-fit.

**Design (operator-chosen +0.10, not the floor):** it's a GATE, not a forced exit value — the trailing still exits at the natural peak−pullback when it fires; the gate only decides *whether it's armed*. Self-scopes to L1 (data: every L2+ trade already has peak−pullback ≥ +0.09; the gate is mathematically incapable of biting above L1). Default −99 = disabled (current behavior preserved). Kept ATR multiplier ×0.5 (validated, needed for runner captures — the gate keeps the wide pullback where it works, disables it only in the L1 whipsaw).

**Build (D11):** config.py field (default −99) · indicators.py gate on both LONG/SHORT price-drop fire (not the TREND_BREAK path — that's always +) · trading_config.json = 0.10 · UI input + load/save (ID 3×) · CURRENT_STATE exit-stack line.

**REVERT GATE:** revert (`→ −99`) if trailing exits net-negative vs the old behavior on N≥30 fresh L1-whipsaw trades (i.e. the suppressed trades ride to SL more than they recover). Watch: do suppressed trades recover (capture) or dump to −1.00 (cost)?

**ADDENDUM (same commit) — Phantom-CF instrument bundled with the gate.** Because the gate adds NO new exit reason (suppressed trades exit via existing TRAILING_STOP L2-5 / STOP_LOSS_WIDE), suppressed fires can't be identified post-hoc. So the gate ships WITH a measurement instrument, mirroring the EMA13-cross-disabled phantom CF (commit a182718): ① `models.py` cols `phantom_trail_suppress_pnl` + `_at` · ② `database.py` auto-migrate ALTERs · ③ `indicators.py` threads `trail_suppressed_pnl` (= would-have-cut pnl_pct) out of `check_exit_conditions` on every gate-blocked fire · ④ `trading_engine.py` (monitor loop, after the check_exit_conditions call ~5267) records `phantom_trail_suppress_pnl` the FIRST time it's set per order · ⑤ `main.py` `_compute_trail_gate_cf(orders)` → payload key `trail_gate_cf` (per-direction: avg phantom vs avg actual, Δpp, held>cut, Total$Δ, verdict ★ SUPPRESS wins / ⚠ REVERT / ✓ Marginal / ⚠ Low N) · ⑥ `templates/index.html` 🛡️ Trailing Min-Profit Gate — Suppressed-Fire CF table (id `trail-gate-cf-body`) below the EMA13 CF table + render JS. **Read gate logged in CURRENT_STATE watchlist (N≥20 fresh suppressed-fires → ⚠ REVERT to −99 / ★ keep +0.10).** Held the gate commit until the instrument was in so the decision is measurable from day one.

### 2026-06-08 — RELAX: EMA-Gap-Expanding filter → `prev2_only` mode (live A/B w/ MARGINAL tag)

**Trigger:** the live **Filter Blocks** table (16-trade 06-08 split report) showed **PAIR_EMA_GAP_NOT_EXPANDING = the #1 entry blocker by a wide margin: 8,684 blocks / 31% of all (29% of LONG, 34% of SHORT)**; next were PAIR_RSI_RANGE (17%) and PAIR_ADX_MAX (12%). Operator concern = too few trades; wanted the dominant *throughput* blocker, not more restrictions.

**Mechanic (was, strict 'both'):** block entry unless the EMA5-EMA13 gap is strictly greater than BOTH prev1 AND prev2 candles — i.e. a *fresh 3-bar expansion high at the entry tick*. Momentum stairsteps (expand→pause→expand) even in healthy trends, so this rejects a large share of valid continuation entries sitting in a 1-candle pause.

**Change:** new `ema_gap_expanding_mode` ('both' default | 'prev2_only'). `prev2_only` drops the prev1 check (block only if gap ≤ prev2), tolerating a 1-candle pause within an intact trend. Shipped live = `prev2_only`. **Theory rationale to relax (not disable):** the filter measures the one orthogonal axis nothing else does — trend-spread *acceleration* (the derivative) vs all the level-based gates (RSI/ADX/gap-level) — so the concept is sound; only the strictness was overdone, and it's belt-and-suspenders with the NO_EXPANSION *exit* (trading_engine.py:4803) that already culls non-developing trades.

**Measurement (live A/B, NOT phantom — these entries actually open):** `entry_gap_expand_marginal` boolean tagged at entry = True iff the trade passed prev2 but would have FAILED prev1 (`gap > prev2 AND gap ≤ prev1`) — exactly the cohort the relaxation newly admits. `indicators.gap_expand_marginal(indicators, dir)` helper (pure read of the same gaps get_signal uses); set in `open_position`. `main._compute_gap_expand_cohort` → payload `gap_expand_cohort`; UI 🪟 Gap-Expand Relaxation table (id `gap-expand-cohort-body`) splits MARGINAL vs STRICT × dir (WR / Avg% / Total$ demux). Build (D11): config.py mode field · indicators.py mode gating of prev1 branch (LONG+SHORT) + helper · trading_config.json='prev2_only' · models.py + database.py column/migrate · UI mode `<select>` + load/save + report line + updated filter description comment + cohort table/render. (Chose live-tag over phantom because the engine tracks post-exit trajectories for real closed trades, not forward P&L for never-opened entries — so admitting+tagging is the only accurate way to measure entry-admission.)

**READ GATE (N≥20 fresh MARGINAL):** ★ keep prev2_only if MARGINAL WR ≥ STRICT AND Total$>0 · ⚠ revert mode→'both' if MARGINAL net-negative OR WR ≫10pp below STRICT. **ABORT EARLY (real $ at risk):** revert to 'both' if MARGINAL WR≤30% OR Total$<−$150 on N≥10. Default 'both' preserved in config.py so legacy behavior is one flip away.

### 2026-06-08 — RE-ADD: BTC RSI×ADX cross-filter SHORT (abort gate tripped on the open experiment)

**Trigger:** the 06-08 evening batch (21:24 export) flipped to mostly SHORTS, all losing. Attribution of the −$734 window: trailing gate = $0 (never fired), gap relaxation = −$89 (1 MARGINAL trade), **rest = pre-existing strategy.** Drilling into the 4 fresh shorts: **4/4 losers, 0% WR, −$577, and ALL 4 fall in cells the removed BTC RSI×ADX SHORT filter would have blocked** — BANK/DASH (BTC RSI 28.7 × ADX 18.0; rule `0-30:25-30` needs ADX 25-30), AAVE/ADA (BTC RSI 30.6/34.7 × ADX 19.8/21.9; rule `30-35:30` needs ADX≥30). Mechanism is textbook: shorting an **oversold BTC (RSI 28-35) with weak trend conviction (ADX 18-22)** = shorting into exhaustion → squeeze; all 4 stopped out (STOP_LOSS / STOP_LOSS_WIDE / PATTERN_FIXED_SL). Exactly the loser zone the filter was built to catch, mirrored short-side.

**Change:** restored `btc_rsi_adx_filter_short` = `30-35:30,35-40:20-26,45-50:25,0-30:25-30` (the archived string). **LONG side left BLANK** — its experiment arm is unresolved AND the lone 06-08 LONG loser (ALLO −$238) shared its BTC cell (RSI 64.7 × ADX 18.4) with 2 winners (ADA, PUMP same minute), so the cross-filter doesn't separate the long loser from long winners; that loss was a high-ATR pair (1.79) × ATR_Runner 2× amplification event (−$119 demux × 2), not a BTC-cross issue. Re-adding LONG would block winners — declined.

**Discipline note:** honored the experiment's pre-committed clause — *"SHORT is the money-maker → tighter watch: if the open SHORT book degrades vs its filtered baseline (WR drop / net-neg on N≥15), re-add SHORT immediately."* N=4 is below the formal N≥15, but 0/4 WR with clean per-cell mechanism attribution = the "draws down past operator comfort" clause; SHORT held to the tighter standard by design. Parser semantics (trading_engine.py:6119): each `RSIlo-RSIhi:ADXlo-ADXhi` rule is an allow-list — block the short when BTC RSI is in-band AND BTC ADX is OUTSIDE the required range. Single ADX value = "requires ADX ≥ that". CURRENT_STATE experiment section updated in place. **Re-evaluation:** if the re-added SHORT filter blocks a would-be-WINNER short (BTC RSI 28-35 × ADX<25-30 that recovers ≥50% WR on N≥6 fresh), revisit the band bounds.

### 2026-06-08 — CAPABILITY: pattern-cell engine generalized (UNMATCHED + combos + block action)

**Context:** truly-unmatched shorts (no C, no W) are a net-loser cohort (9-pool N=23, 43% WR, −$515). Operator asked for a generic way to block/cap/multiply *any* C, W, or combination, both directions — initially to "block truly-unmatched shorts." Investigated: the `pattern_cell_rules` engine already did single-code × direction × {inv_mult, lev_mult, fixed_tp_pct, fixed_sl_pct} and already recognized `UNMATCHED` for *treatment*. Two gaps: combos and a block action.

**Quant decision — do NOT block truly-unmatched shorts.** Against the locked Pattern-C→FILTER gate (N≥30 AND WR≤40% AND Avg≤−0.20% AND NP≥60%) the cohort fails 3 of 4: N=23<30, WR 43%>40%, NP 26%<60% (only Avg −0.222% passes). It carries 7 runners (peak≥0.60); blocking forfeits them. Fix-TP also rejected — sim shows it chops the runners (the cohort's only value) to "save" a minority of poppers (+$115 in-sample but fragile, against "don't chop a winner"). The methodology-correct treatment is a CAP: fix-SL ~−0.50 (sim +$151 in-sample / ~+$90 haircut, kills 1 of 10 winners, targets the non-recovering loser tail). Even that waits for N≥30 on the RESIDUAL after the re-added BTC cross-filter thins the squeeze-shorts (overlap), plus a per-pair concentration check.

### 2026-06-10 — REFINE: RSI-spike guard → require 1-candle jump ≥4 (semantics fix, operator-caught)

**Operator challenge:** "50→51 is not a spike — 50→60 is." Tested both designs on the 11-pool unmatched longs (N=39): (a) the feared false-positive (prev<50 with a small jump) has NEVER occurred — entries need RSI ~54+, so prev<50 mechanically implies jump ≥4; `prev<50` and `prev<50 AND jump≥4` block the IDENTICAL 7 trades (+$554 NET, $60 winner-kill). (b) **Jump size alone does NOT separate**: winner avg jump +5.6 ≈ loser avg +5.8; pure `jump≥5` = NET **−$318** (kills 14 winners incl. NEAR +12.5) — winners accelerate too. The true spike signature is the **sub-neutral origin** (momentum born from below RSI 50 this candle), not the delta. **Change:** added `rsi_spike_min_jump_long=4.0` (0 = pure floor); gate now fires only on `rsi_prev < 50 AND (rsi − rsi_prev) ≥ 4` — historic behavior identical, theoretical 49.8→51 non-spike formally excluded. D11 complete (config/json/engine/UI second input/load/save/report).

### 2026-06-10 — SHIP: Jun-10 guard set (post-crash-batch; 4 changes, operator-directed)

**Context:** first post-reset batch was −$1,101 (−$555L/−$546S, balance →$1,550). Forensics: (a) the unmatched longs that fired were OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION meme spikes (PIPPIN ATR 1.3-1.4, ESPORTS ATR 4.68 = p100 vs historic max-winner 2.49) in a bear tape with a flickering bull regime flag — the 85%-WR cohort was bull-tape majors, a different population; (b) the risk-stacking identity: high-ATR meme → no guard blocks it + widest ATR-SL (−1.20 floor) + 2× unmatched mult + max DOA risk = avg loss $195 vs avg win $29; (c) shorts were squeezed by a mid-session BTC bounce — all entries had BTC 1h RSI 34-40 (hourly oversold). Full 31-variable winners-vs-losers sweep + wider-SL CF run. **Wider SL definitively rejected:** SL−1.5 = −$2,083, SL−2.0 = −$2,497 vs actual −$1,807 (dumps blow through; the V-bounces require surviving −5/−6% = liquidation at 20×). **Fix-TP confirmed irrelevant** (losers' peaks 0.06-0.17 — never reached +0.25).

**Shipped (D11 complete):** ① `btc_rsi_1h_min_short=35` — NEW filter, the session's one real cross-batch lever (monotonic bands, +$690 ex-06-10, 5/7 dates; mechanism = hourly twin of the climax-oversold block). ② `fan_ratio_block_long` 0.85-1.70→0.85-3.00 — window correction of the existing fan gate; the open 1.70-3.00 window held all 06-10 long losers + 06-01/06-09 losers (N=13, −$1,043); fan SUBSUMES the stretch-cap idea (overlap matrix: stacking stretch on fan = strictly worse). ③ `btc_rsi_adx_filter_long` += `70-100:40` + NEW `pair_atr_max_long=2.5` (counters PAIR_ATR_MAX) — free guards, zero historic winners killed. ④ NEW `rsi_prev_min_long=50` RSI-SPIKE GUARD (counter RSI_SPIKE_GUARD) — operator-chosen despite ~zero marginal $ on top of fan (+$69 all-time/−$38 last-6): justified by unique candle-1 coverage (fan needs candles 2-5 to deform; VVV 44.6→65 was spike-only-caught) and capped cost ($60 lifetime winner-kills). **Stack impact: 06-10 batch −$1,385→−$167 (Δ+$1,218, hindsight-fit); last-6 +$21→+$1,311; HONEST forward expectancy ≈ +$30-50/batch ex-06-10.** Overblocking check: throughput 10.3→~8 trades/session; kept book 65% WR / ~+$28/tr in-sample. Spike+stretch redundancy documented (one detector per phenomenon — fan chosen as primary, spike as candle-1 complement, stretch DROPPED). **Operator declined the UNMATCHED-LONG 2×→1× demote** (its ✗-HARMFUL gate sits at N=4 of 5 fresh fires — one more bad fire trips it by rule). Gates in CURRENT_STATE.

### 2026-06-10 — RE-ADD: LONG cross-filter `50-55:99-100` (watchlist band gate tripped) + REVERT max positions 4→5

**① LONG cross-filter 50-55 re-add.** The 06-10 batch's two unmatched-long losers (MORPHO −$160, CHZ −$274 — both BTC RSI 53.6 × ADX 20.4, both passing keep-only-unmatched) fall exactly in the archived `50-55:99-100` block. Validated per the Jun-5 watchlist's PRE-COMMITTED band method ("re-add only bands that confirm net-negative on fresh data"): **50-55 = 3rd consecutive negative window** (full pool −, last-4 −, fresh unmatched N=12, 67% WR but −$396 — fat-tail R:R losers: CHZ/MORPHO/HEI/HIVE vs 8 small winners). Mechanism: BTC mid-range/directionless (RSI 50-55, that morning literally 58% bear breadth under a flickering bull regime) = no tailwind for a momentum long. **60-100 NOT re-added — its own ship gate FAILED:** among unmatched longs (the only longs trading now), BTC RSI 60-65 = N=7, 86% WR, +$368 (keep-only-unmatched FIXED the overbought-long bleed — it was the matched longs). 55-60 stays open. **Ext floor stays OFF** — 0 unmatched longs below ext 0.20 (cohort moot; the pre-committed "does <0.20 still die?" check has no data). Caveats: N=12, 67%-WR-net-losing shape; mitigated by 3-window sign-consistency + pre-committed gate. **Revert: re-blank 50-55 if would-be-blocked longs ≥55% WR AND net-positive on N≥8 fresh.** Config: `btc_rsi_adx_filter_long` "" → "50-55:99-100".

**② max_open_positions 4→5 (REVERT of yesterday's 5→4).** Operator call: with the UNMATCHED-LONG 2× multiplier, a single position reached ~$2,300 of ~$3k margin (base $631 ×2 — MORPHO/CHZ were $1,160 each) — two bad trades = −$434, an outsized equity hit. The 5→4 ship logged exactly this revert trigger ("cluster drawdowns at the bigger size breach operator comfort"). Concentration-vs-deployment resolved toward diversification: per-position base back to ~$505 (×2 mult = ~$1,010). The +25%-deployment idea remains valid in principle but belongs to the post-forward-test scaling phase (with de-levering), not now. Config: `investment.max_open_positions` 4→5.

### 2026-06-09 — SHIP: max_open_positions 5→4 (+25% per-position capital)

**Evidence:** time-weighted concurrency on the 10-pool + 06-09 partial — all 5 slots simultaneously in use only **5.9%** of open-time historically and **0.3%** under the post-cut config (06-08+); 1–3 concurrent positions = ~94% of open-time. The 5th slot was reserving 20% of capital for a state that almost never occurs after the throughput cuts (keep-only-unmatched longs + short filters).

**Change:** `investment.max_open_positions` 5→4 (one line, trading_config.json). equal_split sizing = (balance − reserve)/max_pos → per-position **$505 → $631 (+25%)**. Max total exposure UNCHANGED (5×20% = 4×25% = 100% of balance when full) — only granularity coarsens. `max_open_positions_hard` (redeploy ceiling 10) untouched; redeploy band now starts at ≥4.

**Trade-off accepted:** per-stopped-trade equity hit ~4%→~5%; a correlated 4-cluster = ~20% equity vs 16% before (mitigated: the Jun-8/9 filters specifically target the correlated-cluster entries). Sizing is %-metric-invariant so the keep-only-unmatched forward-test read gates (WR / Avg% / demux) stay clean; only batch $ totals scale.

**Deferred siblings (memory: project_scaling_roadmap):** de-lever-as-balance-grows + drawdown caps — revisit after the forward test passes. **REVERT: back to 5 if the bot measurably hits the 4-cap and forgoes entries on ≥3 sessions (watch had_room=False blocks), or if cluster drawdowns at the bigger size breach operator comfort.**

### 2026-06-09 — SHIP (in-sample, forward-test): KEEP ONLY UNMATCHED LONGS + disable fix-TP

**Finding (the session's biggest):** the 4-Cohort Pattern Coverage, re-simulated on the 10-pool under the **full current stack** (fix-TP +0.25, EMA13-cross-OFF→post-exit ride, wide-SL −1.00 floor, ATR/cell multipliers — both demux and as-sized), shows the cohort edge is **inverted by direction**:
- **LONG:** CROSSED −$218, C-only −$557, **W-only −$1,210**, **TRULY-UNMATCHED +$471 (N=39, 85% WR)** demux. Every individual long pattern is net-negative (W6 −$574, W2 −$480, C7 −$261, C6 −$297, W3 −$294…); the multiplier *amplifies* the matched losses (≥2× longs −$191 demux → −$398 as-sized) but *helps* unmatched (+$471→+$679). No surgical subset works — blocking the top-4 patterns still leaves −$361. The long patterns are caution/countertrend signatures (C7 bounce, W6 top); the no-pattern cohort is clean momentum.
- **SHORT:** matched cohorts win (W-only +$1,047 as-sized), truly-unmatched loses (−$531) → already optimal (unmatched-short block shipped 06-08).

**Exit refinement:** the unmatched longs RUN — 54% peak ≥0.40, 36% peak ≥0.70. The +0.25 fix-TP (built for the pop-and-fade matched cohort) strangles them. Grid: raising the fix-TP is worse (+0.35→+$294, +0.50→+$158); **disabling it and trailing models +$360→+$3,215 demux** (optimistic trailing model — haircut to ~+$1,500–2,200, still 4–6×). So fix-TP OFF for the unmatched runners.

**Change:** new `long_unmatched_only` toggle (default False) — blocks any LONG with c_any OR w_any (counter `LONG_UNMATCHED_ONLY`), keep only unmatched. Set True. `atr_low_fixed_tp_long_enabled`→False (unmatched longs trail). Combined long book −$1,515 → +$471 demux in-sample. Build (D11): config.py field · trading_engine.py filter in open_position (before pattern-cell lookup; uses _pc_any_e/_pw_any_e) · trading_config.json · UI toggle + load/save + report line. **Architecture note:** chose a dedicated toggle over 15 pattern-cell `block` rows — blanket all-or-nothing strategy fits a single robust switch (auto-covers future patterns, trivial to flip for the forward-test); the pattern-cell block feature stays the tool for *surgical* cuts. They coexist (toggle runs before the cell lookup).

**Caveats:** IN-SAMPLE (10-pool, N=39 unmatched-long winners) + drastic (blocks ~80% of longs) + the trailing/EMA13/SL parts are *modeled* from trajectory data. So **forward-test, not proven.** **READ GATE:** keep if unmatched-long cohort ≥70% WR AND net-positive demux on N≥20 fresh full-stack; revert (toggle off + fix-TP back on) if WR<60% OR net-negative on N≥20. **Coupling logged:** if the toggle goes off, the fix-TP must go back on (matched longs need the cap).

### 2026-06-09 — SHIP (DISCIPLINE-OVERRIDE): BTC cross-filter SHORT `30-35:30`→`30-35:30-32`

**Trigger:** the 06-09 bear batch's short loss was a single correlated cluster — SUI/SOL/AVAX shorts fired 08:18-08:19, all BTC RSI 32 + ADX 34, all W2/W6 3×, all reversed (peak 0.00) → −$318 as-sized (97% of the batch short loss). Investigated W2/W6 history: **W2 SHORT is a durable winner** (cross-batch N=74, 70% WR, +$1,510 / +$585 demux); **W6 SHORT (= BTC ADX≥32, single-axis "mature bear") is a net loser** (N=28, 57% WR, −$220 demux) and W6 ⊆ W2 (every W6 short is a W2 short, so W6 is an ADX≥32 overlay that drags W2 into its loser zone — same shape as C1+C6).

**The cut is an INTERACTION, not either variable.** 2×2 on W2 shorts (demux): ADX<32×RSI<35 **+$151** (80% WR) · ADX<32×RSI35-45 **+$655** (78%) · ADX≥32×RSI35-45 **+$179** (100%) · **ADX≥32×RSI<35 −$399 (N=22, 45% WR)** — only that corner loses. So neither "block RSI<35" (oversold wins at ADX<32) nor "retire W6/ADX≥32" (wins at RSI 35-45) is right; the loser is the climax(ADX≥32)+oversold(RSI<35) intersection = exhaustion-bounce. Within RSI 30-35 by ADX: ADX 30-32 **+$43 demux/69% WR** (winner) vs ADX 32-36 **−$551 demux/47%** (loser) — clean boundary at 32.

**Change:** SHORT cross-filter `30-35:30` (require ADX≥30) → `30-35:30-32` (require 30≤ADX≤32; block ADX>32). Full string `30-35:30-32,35-40:20-26,45-50:25,0-30:25-30`. (RSI 0-30 × ADX≥32 already blocked by the `0-30:25-30` rule; the leak was only RSI 30-35.)

**Impact (cross-batch):** blocks 22 trades (12 losers −$1,442 / 10 winners +$562 as-sized; net −$881 as-sized / −$399 demux). SHORT book **−$172→+$709 as-sized (+$881) / demux +$399**. ~1.7 blocks/active-short-day. Preserves the ADX 30-32 winner band + W6 RSI 35-45 100%-WR cell.

**DISCIPLINE-OVERRIDE:** below the locked block gate (N=22<30, WR 45%>40%). Chose BLOCK over de-mux because the cell is −EV even at 1× (−$399 demux, 45% WR) — de-muxing would leave a residual losing cohort trading; and the block is a one-line config change (no build). Interaction is clean (3 winning cells, 1 loser, sound climax-bounce mechanism, confirmed live by the cluster), which de-risks the override. Considered+rejected: de-mux W2 to 1× in the cell (keeps a −EV cohort trading; needs a build); retire W6 (kills the RSI 35-45 100%-WR winners). **REVERT GATE: re-open the cell (`→30-35:30`) if RSI 30-35 × ADX>32 shorts show ≥50% WR on N≥8 fresh.** Config-only change; CURRENT_STATE updated.

### 2026-06-08 — SHIP (DISCIPLINE-OVERRIDE): block UNMATCHED SHORT

**Operator override.** After I recommended a fix-SL cap (not a block) and flagged that the cohort fails the locked Pattern-C→FILTER gate, operator chose to **block truly-unmatched shorts**: set `block:true` on the existing `{UNMATCHED, SHORT}` pattern_cell_rule (was inert 1×). **This is a below-gate / fails-gate ship** (N=23<30, WR 43%>40%, NP 26%<60% — only Avg −0.222% passes), logged transparently per the override rule. **Accepted costs:** (a) forfeits the cohort's runner upside (~7 runners/23, peak≥0.60); (b) blocking renders the cohort UNMEASURABLE going forward — unlike the fix-SL, which would have kept it trading and visible. **Overlap:** the re-added BTC cross-filter already blocks the RSI 30-35 squeeze unmatched-shorts; this block additionally removes the RSI 38-42 residual (UNI/AVAX zone the BTC filter misses) + unmatched shorts in any other RSI zone. **TIGHTER-THAN-STANDARD REVERT GATE:** (1) re-open (block→false) for a 1-batch measurement window at the next ≥30-trade review — if the cohort shows ≥45% WR OR net-positive demux on N≥10 fresh → remove block (or downgrade to `fixed_sl_pct:-0.50`); (2) remove immediately if PATTERN_CELL_BLOCK >15% of SHORT attempts (over-block) OR short throughput thins past operator comfort. Watch the `PATTERN_CELL_BLOCK` counter (LONG should stay 0 — rule is SHORT-only; UNMATCHED LONG remains a 2× multiplier, untouched). One-line config change (`block:true`); no code change (capability already shipped above).

**Build (capability only, no rule populated):** `_lookup_pattern_cell_rule` (trading_engine.py:1790) — added `_rule_side_and_match` helper: `UNMATCHED` = no C & no W; combo `A+B` = AND of all parts; mixed C+W combo resolves to the C side (C-blocks-W). Added `applied_block` accumulation; return is now a 6-tuple `(inv, lev, source, tp, sl, block)`. Call site (open_position ~2851): if `block` → log + `_record_filter_block("PATTERN_CELL_BLOCK", dir)` + `return None` (before sizing/Order creation/exchange call — clean skip). config.py: documented combo syntax + `block` field. UI: pattern cell now a free-text input + datalist (accepts `UNMATCHED`/combos), new **Block** checkbox column, load/collect updated. Standalone logic test passed 6 cases (UNMATCHED fires only when truly unmatched; combo needs all parts; block propagates; direction-scoped; existing C1/C4/C8 singles unaffected). `trading_config.json` pattern_cell_rules UNCHANGED — capability is inert until a rule is added. Watchlist gate for the eventual UNMATCHED-SHORT fix-SL logged in CURRENT_STATE.

### 2026-06-10 (evening) — SHIP: multiplier-audit package (5 changes) + `!` negation in pattern-cell engine + ATR multiplier dimension REMOVED

**Trigger:** before shipping the 55-60 cross-filter rule + W2→W2+W1 cell change, operator asked to audit ALL multiplied cells for the same "value lives in the combo, not the base pattern" disease. Audit (FULL pool + 06-10 CSVs, deduped, demux):
- **C1 SHORT 3× — KEEP.** C1-alone = N=35, 77% WR, +$154 demux. The C1+C6 contaminant (N=8, 50% WR, −$174 demux) was found to be **already 100% fenced**: overlap audit shows all 8 historical C1+C6 shorts entered at BTC RSI 22-35 / 1h-RSI <35 → every one is now blocked by the SHORT cross-filter + `btc_rsi_1h_min_short=35`. C1+C6 block-gate RESOLVED MOOT (no pattern-level block shipped; would be dead code).
- **W6 SHORT 2× — DELETED.** Cell cohort (W6-no-C) N=10, 50% WR, −$37 demux; split: with-W1 +$24 (80% WR) vs without-W1 −$61 (20% WR). Same W2-finding anatomy. Winners auto-covered by the new W2+W1 rule (W6 ⊆ W2).
- **W6+!W1 SHORT → BLOCK (new rule, needed `!` negation).** Mechanism-aware re-sim under TODAY'S stack: the only winner (PHA +$169) is already blocked by the 1h guard; survivors = N=4, 0% WR, −$303 across 3 dates → clears the ≥3-sample direction-consistent bar. Theoretically coherent: macro-bear tag (BTC ADX≥32) with no pair momentum (no W1) = squeeze-prone macro-only short. REVERT GATE: remove if PATTERN_CELL_BLOCK(W6+!W1) >10% of SHORT attempts.
- **W2 SHORT cell → `W2+W1`** (keeps 2×/1.5×). W2+W1 = +$1,480/79% WR (N=14) vs W2-alone −$123 demux (N=16, incl fresh XLM −$210). READ GATE: N≥5 fresh fires, ✗ HARMFUL → demote.
- **ATR Multiplier dimension REMOVED end-to-end** (operator-directed; was `Runner` ATR 1.1-99 2×, Jun 5). Refuted: all-time guard-stack survivors in 1.1-1.5 = N=14, 36% WR, −$328 demux (worst ATR bucket); current-era survivors >0.8 = N=0 (ATR cap + fan + spike guards fence the zone); also fully redundant under keep-only-unmatched (UNMATCHED cell already gives identical 2×/1×, max-wins). Removed: engine `_lookup_atr_multiplier` + candidate, `config.py` field, `trading_config.json` rules, `main.py` `_compute_atr_multiplier_performance` + payload wiring (3 spots), UI rules table + performance table + render + 2 exports + load/save lines. Removal protocol: repo-wide grep clean; py_compile OK.
- **LONG cross-filter → `50-55:99-100,55-60:20-25,70-100:40`.** Adds the validated 55-60:20-25 rule (kills exactly the 2 fresh losers 1000PEPE −$123 + CHZ −$103 at ADX<20, zero winners). DROPS the two 60-65 rules that existed as **UI-only config drift** (net −$21, killed a +$58 winner). 3-rule set dominates the UI 5-rule set: blocks 16 vs 28, kills $146 vs $412 of winners, removes −$1,020 vs −$982. **UI must be synced post-deploy (delete the two 60-65 rows).**
- **UNMATCHED LONG 2× — gate TRIPPED, operator OVERRIDE (kept).** Fresh post-reset N=7, 14% WR, −$546 demux trips the locked ✗-HARMFUL gate (N≥5, Total$<0); robust to the new filters (excl. now-blocked: N=5, −$658). Operator explicitly declined the demote (2nd time, post-trip) — logged as a formal gate violation on operator authority. Replacement gate (tighter, locked): next N≥5 fresh fires under the Jun-10 guard set also net-negative demux → demote to 1× WITHOUT FURTHER DEBATE.
- **Deep-dive (unmatched longs, all axes):** no axis qualifies for a multiplier under the locked promote gate. ATR>1.1 hypothesis refuted (above). BTC RSI non-monotonic noise. Only consistent warm zone = **BTC ADX 20-25 (×RSI 60-70)**: current-era survivors 83% WR +$199 (N=6), all-time 55% WR +$90 (N=124, only positive band) — fails N/WR gates → WATCHLIST with promote gate (WR≥70% + Total$>0 on N≥20 fresh survivors). Equals the existing-but-shadowed BTC cell 60-65×22-25.

**Engine build:** `_rule_side_and_match` extended — `!` prefix negates a part (`W6+!W1` = W6 AND NOT W1); all-negated patterns refused; side from positive parts; C-blocks-W priority means W-side negation rules never fire on C-matched trades (matches the no-C cohort definition the evidence came from). 9-case standalone logic test ALL PASS. UI: pattern-cell help text + placeholder document the syntax (free-text input already accepts it).

### 2026-06-12 — SHIP: pair universe 50→75 + entry_pair_rank tracking + Performance-by-Pair-Rank table

**Trigger:** operator asked where profitable volume could come from without relaxing filters. Boundary audits killed the filter-relaxation candidates (PAIR_ADX_MAX: LONG monotonic decay into the cap, zero data >30, SHORT >35 = N=13 losing + zero current-stack survivors; PAIR_RSI_RANGE LONG 65-70: 18-42% WR, ZERO trades ever peaked ≥1% — flat-liners, not chopped runners). The clean volume lever = universe expansion.

**Evidence for 50→75 (Tier A, rank 51-75 ≈ $49-82M 24h vol):** pool trades at $50-80M vol behave like core book both sides; the bad cohorts live below $50M and only on the LONG side (39% WR) — and the existing global-vol rescue line ($50M, LONG-only, rescue_max 0.6) auto-fences sub-$50M longs in quiet tape. Liquidity caps (0.1%/24h-vol) never bind ≥$49M vs max desired notional $36k. Tier B ($27-49M) NOT opened: long-hostile + caps pinch; Phase-2 idea = shorts-only via $50M long floor.

**API-safety audit (the old 100-pair crash was a REST rate-limit ban, pre-batching era):** at 75 pairs ≈195 weight/scan over ~60-90s cycle ≈ 8% of Binance's 2,400/min; protections now: OHLCV batches of 10 with 5s delay, ccxt enableRateLimit, ban-detect+sleep-until-expiry+DB-persist, scan-loop exponential backoff. WS: one combined connection, 75 @trade streams ≪ 200 cap. Cost: scan sweep +15-20s.

**Build:** ① `entry_pair_rank` column (models.py + database.py auto-migration; CSV export picks it up automatically via model-column introspection) stamped in scan BEFORE blacklist removal (rank = position in eligible top-N) and threaded scan→_collected→open_position→Order. ② `/api/config/pairs-limit` validation: 100 replaced by 75 (operator-directed). ③ UI dropdown: "Top 75" added as new default. ④ `_compute_pair_rank_performance` (buckets 1-10…61-75,>75) + payload + 🏅 UI table (new-tier rows highlighted amber ✦) + both text-report exports. ⑤ trading_config.json `trading_pairs_limit` 50→75.

**READ GATE (locked): N≥20 closed trades at rank 51-75 → compare WR/Avg% vs rank≤50; materially worse → revert limit to 50.** Bonus: rank structure inside the old universe (1-20 vs 21-50) measurable for the first time.

### 2026-06-12 (later) — REVERT: pair universe 75→50 (same-day; audit blind spot, operator-caught)

**What went wrong with the 50→75 ship:** the expansion audit ranked the RAW Binance volume list (raw rank-75 ≈ $49M = "Tier A"), but `get_top_futures_pairs` applies the 180-day new-listing filter (~47 of the highest-volume symbols excluded — recent listings dominate volume) + alpha-subtype filter BEFORE the top-N cut. The bot's ELIGIBLE rank-75 therefore reached **$24M** (operator observed $21M live), squarely in the $27-49M tier the same audit had classified long-hostile (39% WR) + liquidity-cap-pinched. Even eligible rank-50 dips to ~$32M — the old Top 50 was always touching the $30-50M zone (which is also where that tier's training data came from, so status quo restored = no harm done). Net exposure window: ~2h at limit 75.

**Lesson (methodology):** when auditing universe/eligibility questions, reproduce the bot's OWN selection pipeline (eligibility filters → rank), never the exchange's raw ranking. Blocked/excluded cohorts must be measured through the system's lens.

**Reverted:** `trading_pairs_limit` 75→50 (UI immediately by operator, then git), dropdown default back to Top 50 (75 stays selectable). **Kept:** `entry_pair_rank` column + 🏅 Performance by Pair Rank table — buckets restructured to 1-10…41-50 + `>50` catch-all (the 51-60/61-75 rows could never populate at limit 50). **Parked:** ① `min_pair_volume_usd` ≥$40M eligibility floor; ② new-listing 180→90 step-down + `entry_pair_age_days` instrumentation (NOT removal — short-side meme-squeeze tail uncovered: ATR cap LONG-only, short guards BTC-level; ruin-risk asymmetry rules).

### 2026-06-12 (evening) — NO-SHIP ×4: universe/volume/age boundary exploration closed (all rejected by data)

**Context:** operator asked where profitable volume could come from; full boundary exploration ran same-day. Four candidates, four rejections, zero shipped — logged so none get re-litigated without NEW data:

1. **Pair universe 75 — REVERTED same day** (separate entry above): eligible rank-75 = $24M after the 180-day new-listing filter (~47 high-vol pairs excluded pre-cut). Audit lesson: reproduce the bot's own selection pipeline, never raw exchange rankings.
2. **New-listing filter 180→90 days — REJECTED.** Today's snapshot: the 90-180d window holds 30 pairs, exactly ONE would crack the eligible top-50 (SPACE, $85M, 25.6% day range vs 9.5% median for established ≥$30M pairs — ~3× wilder than the calibration universe). Decisive: our actual burns were OLD pairs (ESPORTS ~290d, PIPPIN ~475d, VVV/TRUMP ~450-480d at trade time) — age was NEVER the protective mechanism; the behavioral guard stack (ATR cap, fan, spike, unmatched-only) is, and it's age-blind. The filter's real job = keeping the <90d casino out; both settings do that identically. KEEP 180.
3. **`pair_atr_max_short` — REJECTED (dead code).** 525 historical shorts: ZERO above ATR 2.0, four above 1.5 (net positive); current-stack book shorts max ≈1.25. Structural reason: a short requires bearish EMA stack + RSI 25-50 + pattern match — a squeezing/pumping meme cannot generate a short signal. The LONG ATR cap was necessary (you CAN chase a pump long); the SHORT mirror has nothing to block. Post-entry squeeze tail is bounded by the ATR-widened SL floor (worst trough in 70 book shorts = −1.19% vs floor −1.20).
4. **`min_pair_volume_usd` ≥$40M floor — REJECTED (dead code).** Sub-$40M entries under the current stack: longs 2/134 (1%, −$39), shorts 1/70 (1%, +$23) — three trades, net −$16. Mechanism: bottom-of-universe pairs almost never produce stack-passing signals (gap/expanding/quality need real participation) — the boundary self-protects. The "long-hostile $30-50M" evidence is mostly the $40-50M band, which a $40M floor wouldn't touch anyway.

**Carried forward:** live-mode gap-through-SL tail at 20-30× = a leverage/sizing question → de-lever phase of the scaling roadmap (memory: project_scaling_roadmap). **Kept from today:** `entry_pair_rank` column + 🏅 Performance by Pair Rank table (buckets 1-10…41-50, >50) — first visibility into rank structure inside the Top 50.

**Meta-conclusion:** the current stack + Top-50 is self-protecting at every boundary probed (volume, rank, age, short-ATR). The volume edge is not hiding behind a universe knob; the forward test stays clean and untouched.

### 2026-06-12 (night) — INSTRUMENT: Leash Shadow table repurposed to ALL SHORTS / ALL LONGS + locked SHORT exit-capture gate

**Trigger:** operator flagged the Post-Exit Regret table — winners exit and the move continues (avg post-exit peak +1.3 to +3.3% on trailing exits); with few trades/day the per-winner capture matters. Full leash-shadow read (the 9 virtual exit policies that keep tracking past the actual close):
- **FULL armed pool (N=200, mixed eras): misleading** — every leash hurts LONGS (−12 to −30pp) because that cohort is dominated by pre-keep-only-unmatched matched longs (faders). Cohort discipline applied.
- **Current-stack book shorts (N=20): EVERY leash beats actual.** stren Δ+7.05pp · wide +6.41 · strpk03 +6.33 (16 better/4 worse) · tight-sanity +5.26 (16/4). Recent era (Jun 9+, N=8): tight/strpk/tierA/tierB beat actual 8/8. Mechanism: C1/W2 shorts are capitulation cascades; live exits (trailing L1 + EMA13-short cross) fire on the first micro-bounce minutes in; the cascade continues. Even the 0.25-flat sanity leash beats the live chain → the leak is the exit CHAIN, not just trail width. Uplift likely UNDERSTATED (several leashes still open at tracking-window end). In $: ≈+$300-500/3 days at current sizing (shorts carry 3× multipliers).
- **Current-stack unmatched longs (N=9 / recent N=3): all leashes ≤ actual.** Long trail already optimal — confirmed do-not-touch (consistent with Jun-6 runner-trail wash and the ADA shadow read).

**Build (operator-directed repurpose):** `_compute_leash_shadow` BUCKETS — stale runner-era slices (LONG RUNNER ATR≥1.0, LONG <0.25-stretch control) replaced with ALL SHORTS (gate slice, drill) + ALL LONGS (baseline-expectation control); LEASH set re-expanded to tight/wide/tierA/tierB/strpk/strpk03/stren/strpk_signed (strpk04 dropped, redundant). UI header/title/legend rewritten; gate printed in amber in the table description. Verified on the live batch: 6 armed shorts → strpk Δ+3.68pp/+$1,022 CF, 5 of 6 leashes ★ helps; longs ✗/marginal as expected.

**PROMOTION GATE (locked): at N≥30 armed SHORTS — ship the best leash as the live SHORT exit policy IF Δ≥+0.15pp/trade AND Clean:Trap ≥2:1.** Candidates ranked stren / strpk03 / wide. ETA ~1-2 weeks of fires; zero new instrumentation needed — every closed short adds to the read.

### 2026-06-12 (night, follow-up) — SHIP (DISCIPLINE-OVERRIDE): Runner Stretch-Trail SHORT (shadow-strpk promoted early)

**Operator override.** The locked gate said promote at N≥30 armed shorts; operator shipped at N=20 ("results too conclusive") — logged transparently per the override rule. Evidence at ship: shadow strpk vs actual on current-stack book shorts = Δ+5.06pp/+$996 (N=20, 13/7 better); recent era (Jun 9+) 8/0 better +$979; live batch +$1,022/6 armed shorts; every one of 8 leash variants positive on shorts (stren best $, strpk best recent consistency); leashes are tick-level forward sims (first-trigger-locks, no lookahead; verified _leash_update call sites: live monitor tick + post-exit continuation with EMA13/signal-lost/hard-SL backstops). strpk chosen over stren: existing engine mechanism (Jun-1 runner trail = strpk mechanic), 8/0 recent, operator named it.

**Build (D11):** per-direction generalization of the Jun-1 runner trail. config.py + trading_config.json: `runner_trail_short_enabled=true / _atr_min=0.0 / _arm_peak=0.45 / _k=0.5` (params MUST mirror the measured leash sim: ACT 0.45, no ATR gate). indicators.py: `_runner_armed` + main handoff both direction-aware (atr_min<=0 = gate off); RUNNER_TRAIL log direction-aware. trading_engine.py: realtime tight-trailing suppression direction-aware; **EMA13-short cross suppressed once runner-armed — flips to the existing phantom path** (`phantom_ema13_cross_pnl` recorded, `[EMA13_RUNNER_SUPPRESS]` log) — without this the live version would NOT reproduce the sim (its uplift comes from riding through the first cross). UI: SHORT row in the Runner Stretch-Trail box (4 inputs, load/save, grep-verified 3 refs each); Leash-table header now marks it SHIPPED + revert-monitor. LONG side untouched (OFF, all leashes ≤ actual).

**Known divergence:** live peak-stretch tracked from ENTRY vs shadow's post-arm tracking → live can exit marginally earlier (conservative bias; same semantics as the validated Jun-1 LONG build).

**REVERT GATES (tighter than standard):** ① cumulative (actual − shadow_tight) < 0 on N≥8 fresh armed shorts → OFF (shadow_tight = old-policy proxy, still recording). ② 2 armed shorts converting ≥+0.45 peaks into hard-SL losses → instant review. ③ strpk leash row must ≈ actual once live (sanity); persistent gap = implementation diverges from sim.

### 2026-06-13 — SHIP (DISCIPLINE-OVERRIDE): ATR×GAP LONG block (resolves the high-ATR contradiction)

**Trigger:** ENJ −$253 in 57s (unmatched long, peak 0.0% — never green). Operator flagged the apparent contradiction: we'd historically found ATR>1 GOOD for longs (the ATR_Runner thesis — high-ATR reach the trailing arm, higher peaks), now calling it bad.

**Resolution (the key finding):** high-ATR is high-VARIANCE, not directional. Split high-ATR unmatched longs by trend-extension (pair (EMA13-EMA50)/EMA50 gap), and they separate cleanly: ATR≥1.0 × gap<0.5 = N=14, **64% WR, ~breakeven→+** (FULL) / N=4, **75% WR +$81** (recent) = the genuine runner, fuel for a move just starting — PRESERVED. ATR≥1.0 × gap≥0.5 = N=16, **31% WR, −$611 demux** (FULL) / N=5, **20% WR −$414** (recent) = volatile pair already extended above trend = buying the exhaustion top → reverts. The gap is the cleanest 2nd axis (tested ADX-delta −333/−319, ADX, RSI, stretch, range-pos — none separate the dollars; gap = +$15 vs −$611). Second-order: the ATR-widened SL (−1.20 vs −0.70 base) makes each loss bigger — but that widening is CORRECT for the good runners (they dip before running); the fix is at ENTRY not exit.

**Orthogonality check (operator question):** removing the bad quadrant rehabilitates ZERO banned LONG pattern — re-ran all 17 C/W cohorts, every one stays net-negative after the filter (any-C −$2,599→−$2,655, any-W −$2,514→−$2,187, W6 unchanged −$1,272). The quadrant is only 0-25% of each pattern and lives almost entirely INSIDE the unmatched cohort (unmatched −$1,449→−$838). So this filter is ADDITIVE to keep-only-unmatched, not a pattern-rehab lever; keep-only-unmatched stays correct.

**Build (D11):** config.py `atr_gap_block_long_enabled/_atr_min_long(1.0)/_gap_min_long(0.5)` + evidence comment; trading_config.json (enabled=true); engine block right after PAIR_ATR_MAX (counter `ATR_GAP_LONG`, `_record_filter_block` + `_last_pair_block_reason`); gap recomputed at the filter from indicators ema13/ema50 EXACTLY matching the entry_pair_ema20_ema50_gap_pct field formula ((EMA13-EMA50)/EMA50*100); UI guard row (toggle + 2 inputs, load/save, 3 refs each grep-verified). Verified on the live batch: blocks ENJ (ATR 1.24 × gap +0.94, −$253), passes all 3 winners (PUMP/TAO/FET, ATR 0.28-0.44).

**DISCIPLINE-OVERRIDE:** N=16 full / N=5 recent in the block zone, below the N≥30 filter gate (WR 20-31% clears ≤40%; mechanism clean + winner-preserving + fresh −$253 example justify the override). Precision ~80% (clips HOME +73 / 5 recent). **REVERT GATE: disable if would-be-blocked longs ≥50% WR on N≥8 fresh.** Batch saved (orders_2026-06-13_4L_0S, −$173); pools → 13batches (362) + FULL (1,273). Operator resets after deploy.

### 2026-06-13 (later) — SHIP: Pair Trend Filter split per-direction, SHORT gap≥0 block re-enabled

**Trigger:** analyzing the ATR×gap LONG finding's mirror for shorts. The ATR axis is moot for shorts (structural — short entries exclude high-ATR pairs, N=2 book shorts ≥ATR 1.0). But the GAP axis showed the inverted mirror: book shorts by trend-extension — gap −0.8..−0.5 (breakdown confirmed) = 95% WR +$476; **gap 0..+0.3 (at/above trend) = 0% WR −$247**; gap −0.2..0 (mild) = 43% WR −$192. Longs enter early (not extended up); shorts enter late (already below trend) — same mechanism, opposite sign.

**Found the filter already existed but was OFF + bidirectional.** `pair_trend_filter_enabled` (May 7, blocks LONG when EMA13<EMA50 AND SHORT when EMA13>EMA50) was disabled in current config. The gap≥0 short losers are all May8–Jun1 (the off-era). Could NOT just flip it on: bidirectional → would also block gap<0 unmatched longs = N=67, 58% WR, −$27 (≈breakeven, fine). So split it.

**Build (D11):** config.py — retired `pair_trend_filter_enabled` into `pair_trend_filter_long_enabled`(False) + `pair_trend_filter_short_enabled`(True) + `pair_trend_short_gap_max`(0.0, the SHORT block threshold, parameterized so the watchlist −0.2 tightening is a config change). Engine: per-direction gate; SHORT now blocks when `gap >= short_gap_max` (was hardcoded EMA13>EMA50). trading_config.json updated. UI: single toggle → LONG/SHORT toggles + gap-max number input (load/save, 3 refs each grep-verified; old id fully removed). Counter unchanged (PAIR_TREND_FILTER).

**Watchlist:** tighten `pair_trend_short_gap_max` 0 → −0.2 when the −0.2..0 zone confirms ≤35% WR on N≥30. **Revert:** re-disable short side if would-be-blocked (gap≥0) shorts ≥50% WR on N≥8 fresh. Note: C1 (capitulation) shorts already require pair_gap≤−0.50 so can't land in the blocked zone; the leak this closes is W-pattern shorts near/above trend.

### 2026-06-13 (night) — SHIP: Phantom Flip Tracker (observation-only "fade the block" instrumentation)

**Trigger:** operator proposed (3×, across fan-ratio / ATR×gap / pair-trend) that since these filters cleanly mark loser entries, we should FLIP them — block-long → enter short, block-short → enter long. The trough/peak data supports a directional tilt (ATR×gap-block longs: avg trough −0.76% vs peak +0.39%; ENJ fell −1.21% after block). But the naive sign-flip P&L (+3-4pp) is a mirage (MAE not realized) and faces structural incoherence (our short system is cascade-continuation w/ stretch-trail + 3× multipliers — wrong machinery for a mean-reversion fade) + high-ATR loser tail (HOME rose +1.85% → a flip-short eats its SL). So instead of trading the mirror, INSTRUMENT it: measure realized flip P&L with a real exit.

**Build (observation-only, fail-silent, modeled on the leash system):** `models.py` PhantomFlip table (auto-creates via create_all). `trading_engine.py`: module-level `_PHANTOM_FLIP_STATE` + `_seed_phantom_flip()` (de-duped — the block filters re-fire every scan cycle a pair sits in the zone, so 1 phantom per pair|source per 30min cooldown) seeded at the 3 block sites (FAN_RATIO_GATE both dirs, ATR_GAP_LONG, PAIR_TREND_FILTER short); `async update_phantom_flips()` called each monitor tick (1s) — prices each phantom from the ws feed, applies base SL −0.70 / arm +0.45 / trail −0.25 / 45min horizon, persists realized P&L per isolated DB session. main.py: monitor-loop call + `_compute_phantom_flip_performance(db,is_paper)` aggregating by source×flip_dir (N/WR/avg%/total%/SL-rate/peak/trough/verdict) + payload key. UI: 🔄 Phantom Flip Tracker table + render. Unit-tested the exit model: ENJ-flip-short → +0.96% trailed (NOT the mirror +1.21%), HOME-flip-short → −0.70 SL — exactly the realistic picture the mirror hid.

**READ GATE: N≥30 per source×flip cell. ★ flip pays (avg≥+0.10%, WR≥50%) → design a proper mean-reversion sleeve (own quick-target exits), NOT a filter-flip. ✗ whipsaws → delete the tracker (grep PHANTOM_FLIP).** Granularity caveat logged. Zero live-trading impact.

### 2026-06-13 (night, follow-up) — Phantom Flip: + BTC_RSI_ADX_CROSS source (extremes only)

Operator extended the fade idea to the BTC RSI×ADX macro cross. Added it as a 4th phantom-flip source, EXTREMES ONLY: BTC RSI≥70 long-block→fade short, ≤35 short-block→fade long (mid-RSI cells are directionless, skipped). Flagged as a MACRO/correlated bet (BTC state is the same for all pairs → a blocked cell flips a basket, not independent trades) — read separately from the pair-level reversion fades. Analysis lean: the short-cross flip (oversold→long bounce) is the cleaner candidate; the long-cross flip (overbought→short) fights a strong BTC uptrend (ADX≥40) and is riskier — but we MEASURE both rather than decide. Engine seed at the BTC_RSI_ADX_CROSS block site gated on the extreme; compute sources list + UI text updated. **Deferred the "solely-blocked-by-X" semantics refactor** (continue-past-block to confirm no later filter also blocks) — too invasive for an observation tool; the proxy ("blocked by X, passed all prior filters") is acceptable for these late-stack filters, and the UI now labels it honestly. Read gate unchanged (N≥30/cell; ★→mean-reversion sleeve, ✗→delete).

### 2026-06-13 (night) — Phantom Flip: + LONG_UNMATCHED_ONLY source (matched-long → short, the strongest candidate)

Operator extended the fade test to the pattern cohorts. Proxy ranking across all flip candidates: MATCHED LONGS → SHORT is the standout by far — N=271 (vs 7-16 for the filter cohorts), +0.142pp/trade proxy estimate, coherent mechanism (matched longs are countertrend/exhaustion: C7=dead-cat-bounce-long, W6=BTC-top — they fail as longs because the pair reverses; the short catches the reversal). C7 sub-cell sharpest (+0.259/trade, N=41 = short the failed dead-cat bounce, textbook continuation). UNMATCHED SHORTS → LONG rejected (N=327 but origWR 60%, edge +0.008 ≈ wash). Seeded `_seed_phantom_flip(pair, current_price, "LONG", "LONG_UNMATCHED_ONLY")` at the keep-only-unmatched block in open_position (fires on matched longs → flip SHORT). Naming note: the filter is named for what it KEEPS (unmatched) but FIRES on what it drops (matched) — the block event IS a matched long. Compute sources + UI updated. Caveat unchanged: proxy overstates (ENJ −1.21 trough → +0.96 realized); a flip-short on a matched long needs its own mean-reversion exits (not the cascade machinery). READ GATE: N≥30 realized per cell; ★ → build a mean-reversion short sleeve, do NOT live-flip on proxy. The N=271 base means this cell accumulates tracker N fast.

### 2026-06-17 — FIX: Entry Funnel all-zeros (Counter NameError) + Opened-NORMAL/FLIP direction split

**Built (earlier same day):** the Entry Funnel diagnostic — proves the bot opens only flips because the filter stack rejects momentum signals (not a bug, not the 5-position cap). Split "Opened — NORMAL/FLIP" and "Blocked by filter" by direction (L/S) via a single `Counter` pass over `all_orders` in `_compute_performance` (main.py ~6795); UI cells + both text exports. **Bug (operator caught — "seems bugged", dashboard all-zeros):** `Counter` was used but only imported locally in OTHER functions (8876/9125), never in `_compute_performance` → `NameError` swallowed by the funnel's `except` → all-zeros default while the Filter Blocks table (separate `_get_filter_block_summary` call) correctly showed ~250 blocks. Exactly the D11 "all-zeros dashboard = suspect a perf-compute exception" failure mode in our own rules. Fix: `from collections import Counter` inside the try (commit 89f0ce8). Verified the funnel then yields Opened FLIP N(0L/NS), Opened NORMAL 0. Funnel split commit 61c34d3.

### 2026-06-17 — SHIP (DISCIPLINE-OVERRIDE): 2D flip-SHORT regime×ADXΔ entry filter (fulfills the standing universal-regime-gate)

**Trigger:** fresh batches opened all-flip-short and bled in bull/chop (regime had flipped from the bear batches where flip-shorts pay). Operator: ship the regime gate the standing watchlist called for.

**Finding (deduped pool 76+39+11, flip-shorts, key=opened_at|pair|direction):** the dividers are ORTHOGONAL — ADXΔ sign splits ~50/50 WITHIN each regime family, so the 2D intersection sharpens both. 2D cells: BEAR∧ADXΔ≥0 = N=25/68%WR/+$1490 (golden, future multiplier); BULL/CHOP∧ADXΔ<0 = N=38/40%WR/−0.34%/−$1070 (block). ADXΔ≥0 is the better SINGLE divider (44%→63% WR swing) but neither 1D passes the WR≤40% filter gate alone (both dilute) — only the intersection does. **NP-gate caveat resolved:** literal Never-Positive on the block cell = 13% (≪60% gate) — but 96% of its losers peak BELOW the 0.45 arm, so the give-back cap provably can't save them → it IS entry-territory, not exit. Per-pair concentration 43% (dimensional, not a pair-blacklist). Counterfactual: last(bear) batch −$63 [filter dormant — bear excluded by design], current(bull) batch −$611→−$5.

**Build (D11):** config.py `flip_short_regime_block_adxd_max(0.0)` + `flip_short_regime_block_regimes("STRONG_BULL,HEALTHY_BULL,CHOPPY_FLAT")` (empty regimes = OFF, no boolean); trading_config.json; universal block at the TOP of `_flip_filters` (reason `FLIP_SHORT_REGIME`, rides `_record_filter_block`); `_ff_in` gains flip_dir/adx_delta/btc_regime (regime classified from globals if unrecorded); UI 2 inputs in the FLIP panel (later merged to one full-width row for clarity). Verified the live filter blocks exactly the 8 bleeders / keeps the 3 on the current batch. Commit 43653da; UI one-line fix + per-source watchlist 99d48d3.

**DISCIPLINE-OVERRIDE** (NP literal 13%<60%, overridden by arm-saveability). **TIGHT REVERT: re-open the blocked cells if they flip to WR>45% on N≥15 fresh.** **PER-SOURCE WATCHLIST (operator-flagged):** the −$1070 cell is 97% FAN_RATIO_GATE (N=37); PAIR_RSI_OB has N=1 in-cell and it WON (+$21, net-positive pool-wide N=15/80%WR); LONG_UNMATCHED zero data. Universal is mechanism-justified but data-unproven for non-FAN. GATE: scope to FAN-only if PAIR_RSI_OB bull/chop∧ADXΔ<0 stays net-positive/WR≥55% on N≥10-15.

### 2026-06-17 — SHIP: passthrough-long tracker (bull-mechanism hunt, observation-only)

**Concept:** the flip-short fade is a BEAR mechanism (fade a wrong signal). The BULL mechanism is the OPPOSITE of fading — the engine WANTS to go long (311 blocked longs/batch) but the macro gates kill them; if those blocked longs would WIN as longs in bull, the fix is to RELAX the gate (re-enable normal longs), not spin up a flip sleeve. Literal short→long mirror is starved in bull (≈no short signals to fade). So instead: PASSTHROUGH — seed the blocked long SAME-direction.

**Build (zero schema change):** `_seed_phantom_flip` gains `mode='FADE'|'PASS'` (PASS → flip_dir = blocked_dir). Seeded as `PASS:<filter>` at the 3 Tier-1 macro long-block sites (BTC_ADX_GATE_LOW, BTC_RSI_ADX_CROSS, FAN_RATIO_GATE — the last is a free A/B vs its existing fade). Tier selection: macro gates only (high-N, the over-block hypothesis); excluded structural/safety + tiny-N + pair-setup filters. PASS rows are EXCLUDED from the fade aggregates (main.py split `_all_flips` vs `flips`) and route ONLY into the existing Source×BTC-Regime cross-tab as LONG rows — rides existing D12 surfaces. Commit 43653da. **Early read (small N, single window): NEGATIVE so far** — PASS:FAN_RATIO_GATE LONG 18%WR/−0.41, PASS:BTC_RSI_ADX_CROSS 50%/−0.11 → macro gates look correctly conservative; no bull edge to harvest yet. Refinement: BULL xtab column later split STRONG vs HEALTHY (commit e211f42) so a strong-bull edge isn't hidden inside a weak-bull average.

### 2026-06-17 PM — CONFIG: disable LONG_UNMATCHED_ONLY flip (live off, phantom-only)

**Evidence:** live N=0 both recent batches (structurally starved — its trigger, a matched long surviving to the keep-only-unmatched stage, is rarely reached because longs die at the upstream macro gates first); phantom N≈8/38%WR/−0.190% ✗ whipsaws (the weakest of the 3 sleeves). Operator: not enough good data to keep it active. `flip_entry_sources` → `"FAN_RATIO_GATE:1.0,PAIR_RSI_OB:1.0"` (config.py + trading_config.json). The phantom seed (line 3327) is DECOUPLED from the registry (always fires) so the tracker keeps accruing for a future re-enable. **RE-ENABLE GATE: phantom WR≥55% AND net-positive on N≥20.** Verified: registry excludes it, `_flip_active("LONG_UNMATCHED_ONLY")`=False, phantom seed still fires. Commit e211f42.

### 2026-06-17 — WATCHLIST: flip-SHORT liquidity×ATR squeeze-gap guard (the SKYAI tail)

SKYAI flip-short (FAN⊘LONG→SHORT, STRONG_BEAR, 2× cell) lost −1.21%/−$253 in 44s: shorted a small-cap ($92M vol, rank 32) high-ATR (1.49%) parabolic-fan (2.76) alt that squeezed +1.14% straight up — never armed (peak 0.0), and the −0.70 SL GAPPED to −1.21 on the fast move. Signature = small-cap + high pair ATR + parabolic fan → squeeze gaps the monitored stop. No live guard catches it (FLIP_FAN_SPIKE is ≥5 and the 2-5 band is a kept edge; meme guard is LONG-only & ATR 1.49<2.5; 2D regime filter correctly exempts STRONG_BEAR; give-back cap can't help never-armed). PROPOSAL (when N accrues): flip-SHORT entry guard on pair vol < ~$100-150M AND pair ATR ≥ ~1.2-1.5% (block or down-size-to-1×), NOT on fan alone. N=1 fat-tail, NOT shippable. Recorded in CURRENT_STATE with tracking plan (stop-overshoot by pair-vol×ATR; ship at N≥8-10 cluster, must not chop bear-regime winners). Commit e211f42 (the watchlist note).

### 2026-06-17 — KNOWN BUG (identified, parked for the closed-order CSV): FAN multiplier leaks onto flip-LONGs

Operator spotted a live BCHUSDT flip-**LONG** carrying `FLIP:FAN_RATIO_GATE×2` (2× size, $20,955 notional). Root cause: the `flip_fan_mult_rule` cell (`40-45:35-99:2.0`, validated ONLY on SHORT fades into strong-bear) is applied in `_flip_filters` (lines ~330-344) with NO direction check → any FAN flip matching the BTC RSI/ADX cell inherits the 2×, including a flip-LONG (blocked SHORT → LONG). Worse: it sizes 2× into BTC RSI 40-45 (bearish-leaning), the opposite of the cell's context. Same direction-agnostic structure likely also leaks the FAN regime-block and strpk exit onto flip-LONGs. Fix deferred to when the order closes + CSV (operator's call): gate the multiplier — and likely the whole FAN entry branch — to `flip_dir=='SHORT'`. No change made yet.

### 2026-06-17 PM — SHIP (operator, MIRROR): flip-LONG regime gate (FLIP_LONG_REGIME)

Mirror of the validated flip-SHORT 2D gate, for the long side. A flip-LONG (a blocked SHORT faded → LONG) in a bear regime = long-into-the-trend. This batch's two flip-LONGs, AAVE+TAO (STRONG_BEAR, RSI~34), went straight to SL = 2/0%WR/−$220 (real Source×Regime: `FAN_RATIO_GATE LONG · S.BEAR = 2/0%/−1.10/−$220`). KEY ASYMMETRY vs the short gate (ADXΔ<0 cut): the long losers were ADXΔ-AGNOSTIC (ADXΔ +1.5 — regime was the killer), so `flip_long_regime_block_adxd_max=99.0` = REGIME-ONLY block, `flip_long_regime_block_regimes="STRONG_BEAR,HEALTHY_BEAR,CHOPPY_FLAT"`. `BEAR_EXHAUSTED` excluded on purpose (winding-down bear → mean-reversion long defensible). Block in `_flip_filters` gated to `flip_dir=='LONG'`, reason `FLIP_LONG_REGIME` (auto-counts via `_record_filter_block`); D11 wired (config.py + trading_config.json + UI input/load/save, cyan row). Simulated: blocks AAVE+TAO, shorts untouched. DISCIPLINE: shipped on N=2 (operator-directed, below the N≥15 bar) — structural mirror of a shipped filter, mechanism-justified but thin sample. TIGHT REVERT: re-open the bear cells if would-be-blocked flip-LONGs flip to WR>45% on N≥15 fresh. Why the entry gate, not a wider stop: operator-requested ATR-SL check this batch showed a −1.5×ATR stop saves only 1/4 losers (SKYAI, razor-thin) and deepens the other 3 — no stop saves a wrong-direction entry.

### 2026-06-17 PM — SHIP (operator): give-back cap DISABLED (frac 0.35→0); N held 0.5

`runner_trail_short_giveback_frac` 0.35→0.0 (the `_sp_frac>0` guard clean-disables → floor reverts to `max(peak − N×ATR, lock)`). RATIONALE: the give-back cap was designed to protect bull/chop BOUNCE-FADE shorts (peak-then-reverse) — but those are now BLOCKED by FLIP_SHORT_REGIME, so the cap guards a population that no longer trades while CLIPPING the bear-regime TREND runners the filter leaves us. Evidence: SKYAI (STRONG_BEAR runner) capped at +0.30 close vs +3.92% post-exit continuation with only −0.02 retrace = a continuous trend the ATR-floor would've ridden to ~+3.3. The BE-ratchet (lock) IS the round-trip backstop and makes the cap redundant: re-ran VELVET (pk+0.76/ATR1.59) cap-off → floor=max(0.76−0.80,0.10)=+0.10, still flat not the −1.20 SL. Recommended DISABLE cap + KEEP ratchet (best option); disabling the ratchet instead would be worst (loses round-trip safety, keeps clipping). N=0.5 HELD: operator asked to bump→1.0 ("now that we have BE"); I recommended HOLD — the BE-lock makes N=1.0 SAFE (downside bounded) but not proven BETTER; zero distinguishing evidence (lone runner trended → atr05/10/15 identical); and it'd be a 3rd same-direction loosening (one-change-at-a-time). REVERT GATE (cap): re-enable frac→0.35 if an armed bear runner round-trips peak≥+0.45→≤0 on N≥3 fresh (lock proves insufficient).

### 2026-06-17 PM — FIX: ATR-shadow leash made LOCK-AWARE (decision surface for N)

The atr05/10/15 leash shadows tested a LOCKLESS chandelier (`pnl ≤ peak − N×ATR`), but the live runner floor is now `max(peak − N×ATR, lock)` (cap-off, BE-ratchet on). So `atr05` did NOT mirror the live config — on low-peak reversers the lockless shadow fell through to hard-SL while live holds at +0.10 — meaning the table could not validly decide N=0.5 vs 1.0 under the policy actually run. FIX: the atr shadows now read `runner_trail_short_be_lock_pct` + `be_ratchet_enabled` and apply `floor=max(peak−N×ATR, lock)` (reason tags `lock` vs `atr`). Result: `atr05` = EXACT live config, `atr10`/`atr15` = the N=1.0/1.5 candidates under the same lock = clean decision surface. Only changes low-peak reversers (caught at the lock, matching live); trending runners unaffected (high peak → ATR-floor > lock anyway). UI helper text updated to document atr*→N and cap*→give-back-cap decision rows. GATE (decide N with data): bump `runner_trail_short_atr_mult`→1.0 only if `atr10` beats `atr05` cumulatively on N≥8 fresh armed shorts. This is the empirical path the operator's "later decide the best configuration" asked for. `slconv` (counts `hard_sl` only) unaffected by the new `lock` reason.

### 2026-06-17 PM — WATCHLIST: flip-SHORT ATR≥2 × REGIME (2D inversion); both rules HELD on thin/one-window N

Investigated 3 consecutive ATR>2 flip-short losses (AGT 2.1, HUSDT 3.0, ESPORTS 4.0 — all STRONG_BEAR, all never-armed, all gapped −0.70 SL to ~−1.2). ATR>2 ALONE is non-monotonic (pooled >2.00 bucket = 100% WR/+$495/N=4 — high ATR is the *best* bucket), so hunted the 2nd axis. Found: BTC regime, running OPPOSITE to the normal flip-short edge — deduped pool, ATR≥2 flip-shorts WIN in BULL (3W/0L, +$223, 2 batches) and LOSE in STRONG_BEAR. Mechanism: a FAN flip shorts a parabolic pump; in a strong bear that's a counter-trend short-squeeze that keeps ripping (never arms, high ATR gaps the stop); in a bull it's an exhausting overextension that the fade mean-reverts. INTERACTION: FLIP_SHORT_REGIME has it backwards for ATR≥2 — blocks bull/chop∧ADXΔ<0 (kills the high-ATR bull winners HUSDT-W/EVAA-W) and exempts bear (keeps the high-ATR losers). Operator proposed shipping both (ATR≥2∧bear→block, ATR≥2∧bull→unblock) ASAP. PER-BATCH INDEPENDENCE CHECK refuted shipping: the entire bear∧ATR≥2 loss is ONE ~10-min window today (3 correlated never-armed losses, −$366); the only out-of-window bear∧ATR≥2 sample (BR, ATR2.0) WON +1.81%/peaked +3.34% → 1-big-winner vs 1-bad-window = correlated-cluster overfit, not a cross-batch loser. The bull-unblock is more consistent (3W/0L, 2 batches) and low-risk (the filter's −$691 value is entirely ATR<2, the ATR≥2 slice is 2W/0L) but rests on N=2–3 and loosens a validated filter. DECISION: HOLD BOTH, watchlist with gates — BLOCK at ≤30% WR on N≥8 across ≥3 separate windows; CARVE-OUT (unblock) at ≥60% WR on N≥6–8 for bull∧ADXΔ<0∧ATR≥2. Retired the SKYAI liquidity×ATR framing (AGT/HUSDT mid-cap $175–227M → liquidity is NOT the discriminator, regime is). CURRENT_STATE watchlist updated in place. No code change.

### 2026-06-17 PM — SHIP (operator, discipline-override N=2): flip-SHORT high-ATR bear block (FLIP_SHORT_HIATR), cut ≥3

Carve-out to FLIP_SHORT_REGIME's bear exemption: block flip-SHORT when pair ATR% ≥ 3.0 AND BTC regime ∈ {STRONG_BEAR,HEALTHY_BEAR,BEAR_EXHAUSTED}. `flip_short_atr_block_min=3.0` + `flip_short_atr_block_regimes`; block in `_flip_filters` gated to flip_dir=='SHORT', reason FLIP_SHORT_HIATR (auto-counts via _record_filter_block); added `atr_pct` to the `_ff_in` filter input; D11 wired (config.py + trading_config.json + UI rose row + load/save). MECHANISM: a high-ATR parabolic pump in a strong bear is a counter-trend short-SQUEEZE that keeps ripping → the fresh short never arms and the high ATR gaps the −0.70 SL to ~−1.2 (ESPORTS 4.0, HUSDT 3.0 = 0%WR/−$245 this window). The same high-ATR pair WINS in a bull (regime inversion, HUSDT 3.9 / ESPORTS 2.6 bull = W) so the block is bear-only. CUT REFINED ≥2 → ≥3 after the operator asked "is it >2, >3 or >4": bear flip-shorts by ATR = 1.5 STG-W/PORTAL-W (+$362), 1.9 EVAA-L, 2.0 BR-W (+$272), 2.1 AGT-L, 3.0 HUSDT-L, 4.0 ESPORTS-L → the clean 0%-WR cliff is ATR≥3; ATR<2.5 is net-POSITIVE (cutting at 2 would kill PORTAL/BR/STG winners and only nets −$94 because BR offsets). Sim verified: ESPORTS+HUSDT blocked, AGT/BR/PORTAL allowed, bull high-ATR allowed. DISCIPLINE: N=2, both ATR≥3 losers from one bear window today — operator-directed override below the N≥8/≥3-window gate. TIGHT REVERT: raise min toward 4 or drop the regime if blocked ATR≥3 bear shorts would have ≥40% WR on N≥6 fresh (track via phantom + LIVE Flip Trades × BTC-Regime). Exact cut (2.5/3/4) unresolved on N=2. Context: this closed a multi-message investigation that also REJECTED widening the SL (tested N=3 + N=11, net-negative/tail-driven, ruin-unsafe at 20×) — the lever is entry (this block), not exit.

### 2026-06-17 PM — SHIP (operator): flip-SHORT B2 (strong-bull any-ADXΔ) + B1 (anti-parabola stretch≥2)

Two new flip-SHORT entry blockers from the PAIR_RSI_OB bull-short losses this window: ESPORTS (STRONG_BULL, EMA5 stretch 10.47%, RSI 94.5, ATR 5.73 → −2.25%/−$225 gapped stop in 0s, a parabolic blow-off) and TAC (STRONG_BULL, stretch 0.40, RSI 68.8 → −1.20% ordinary wrong-way bull short). Neither was caught by the existing stack (FLIP_SHORT_REGIME needs ADXΔ<0 — both had ADXΔ>0 +3.76/+1.20; FLIP_SHORT_HIATR is bear-only; PAIR_RSI_OB has no source filters).

B2 = `flip_short_regime_block_any_adxd_regimes="STRONG_BULL"`: block flip-SHORT in STRONG_BULL regardless of ADXΔ. Cross-pool (N=111 short flips) STRONG_BULL loses in BOTH ADXΔ halves — ADXΔ<0 −$190/55%WR/N=11 (already blocked) + ADXΔ≥0 −$531/47%WR/N=15 (was leaking through the ADXΔ<0-only gate). Strong-bull-specific: healthy-bull/chop ADXΔ≥0 ≈ breakeven (−$103/N=16) so they stay at the ADXΔ<0 cut. Catches both ESPORTS+TAC. Mechanism: don't short a strong bull. Engine: added an any-ADXΔ regime set checked before the ADXΔ<0 branch (same FLIP_SHORT_REGIME reason).

B1 = `flip_short_stretch_block_max=2.0`: block flip-SHORT when entry EMA5 stretch% ≥ 2 (anti-parabola — shorting a vertical blow-off that keeps ripping). Pool stretch≥2 = N=2/0%WR (ASTER+ESPORTS), 0 winners removed (the 1–2% band is 67%WR, preserved; cut sits cleanly between). Regime-agnostic catastrophe guard (catches a blow-off B2 misses, e.g. ASTER in CHOPPY_FLAT). Reason FLIP_SHORT_HISTRETCH, checked before the regime block so a parabola tags distinctly. Uses ema5_stretch already in _ff_in.

Complementary (near-disjoint trades: B2=regime/TAC, B1=parabola/ASTER, overlap only ESPORTS) so attribution stays clean. On the prechange-39 + current-2 batches: PREVIOUS +$454 → POST +$952, all 3 pool losers removed, 0 winners touched (B2 had ZERO false positives on the prechange batch). D11 wired (config + json + UI orange/rose row + load/save). Sim verified: ESPORTS→B1, TAC→B2, ASTER→B1, healthy-bull-ADXΔ>0 + bear correctly allowed.

DISCIPLINE: B2's independent edge is MILD (~63% of the −$531 is the 2 in-sample motivators → ~−$197/13 independent) and it WIDENS a filter validated on ADXΔ<0 — so STRONG_BULL-only + a tight revert: re-add the ADXΔ<0 requirement for STRONG_BULL if its ADXΔ≥0 shorts hit ≥50% WR on N≥10 fresh. B1 is N≈1 independent but a never-false-positive catastrophe guard (justified as risk mgmt, not edge): raise toward 3 / off if a stretch∈[2,3] flip-short wins on N≥5 fresh. Note: PAIR_RSI_OB (both losers' source) still has no source filters and is 0/N live — separate watch.

### 2026-06-18 — CONFIG (operator): blacklist ESPORTSUSDT (per-pair concentration, serial parabolic-pump loser)

ESPORTS flip-shorts lost in 3 straight batches: 21:53 ATR4.0 STRONG_BEAR −1.24 (now caught by HIATR), 23:00 ATR5.7 STRONG_BULL stretch10.47 −2.25 (caught by B1), 00:17 ATR7.4 HEALTHY_BULL stretch0.08 −1.20 (slipped EVERY filter — healthy-bull so B2/regime miss, ema5-stretch 0.08<2 so B1 misses, bull so HIATR is bear-only). The dimension values MORPH each batch (stretch 0.86↔10.47↔0.08, regime bear↔strong-bull↔healthy-bull, ATR rising 4.0→5.7→7.4), so dimension filters play whack-a-mole; the only constant is the pair. Per the locked per-pair-concentration rule (≥60% of a loser zone in 1–2 pairs → blacklist, not a dimension filter), ESPORTS is ~100% of the catastrophic flip-short losses while the cohort wins (HU/TAC/VELVET all +0.10 this batch). NOT a new-listing case: Binance onboardDate 2025-07-29 = 323 days (past the live 180-day new_listing_filter; subtype Gaming, not Alpha) — verified via fapi exchangeInfo. NOT a bug: all 4 trades evaluated correctly through the filters, none mis-blocked; the −0.70 SL gapped to −1.20 normally on a 7.44% ATR pair; the new filters only add blocks (no regression). Added ESPORTSUSDT to pair_blacklist (trading_config.json). Verified the blacklist covers flips: the scan fans over top_pairs (engine ~6510) which the blacklist filters at ~6220, so a blacklisted pair is never scanned → no signal → no block → no flip (live or phantom). This also confirms the new-listing filter structurally covers flips too (ESPORTS slipped only because it's 323d, not a bypass). Operator deferred the separate flip↔new-listing fail-open audit (missing-onboardDate pairs kept conservatively) to later.

### 2026-06-18 — CONFIG (operator): disable the SHORT BE-ratchet (runner_trail_short_be_ratchet_enabled true→false)

Operator asked to remove the BE-ratchet (lock 0.10). Investigated on the prechange-39 batch first: of 36 shorts, 26 armed (peak≥0.45); the lock would have cut 0 winners (by construction it can't cap a runner — once a runner runs the ATR-floor trails it up and the lock goes dormant) and saved only 4 SMALL round-trips (EVAA −0.36, PORTAL −0.13, PORTAL −0.02, AERO −0.02 → +0.10 each ≈ +$139, possibly in-sample). My counter-argument to keep it cited VELVET (pk0.76→−1.20 round-trip) as the big-save case — OPERATOR CORRECTED: VELVET was a flip-LONG, and the ratchet is short-only, so it never covered that. With VELVET removed, no SHORT has been observed arming then round-tripping to the SL, so the dramatic-save scenario is unproven for shorts; residual value is just the modest small-saves. Clarified the winner-cutting mechanism was the GIVE-BACK CAP (SKYAI +0.30 vs +3.92), already disabled — the lock cuts no winners, so removing it recovers no upside, it only drops a small safety. Net: removing is mildly net-negative (−$139/batch of small saves) but low-stakes and not dangerous. CURRENT runner-exit stack is now ATR-floor(N=0.5) ONLY — no cap, no lock; an armed short that fully reverses rides to the −0.70 hard SL. trading_config.json only (toggle already wired). RE-ADD GATE: re-enable if a SHORT arms (peak≥0.45) then round-trips to the −0.70 SL on N≥2 fresh.

### 2026-06-18 — CONFIG (operator): RE-ENABLE the SHORT BE-ratchet (revert same-day disable — was a mistake)

Operator clarified the prior-message disable was not intended — re-enabled `runner_trail_short_be_ratchet_enabled` false→true. Decision: keep the lock ON (it cuts 0 winners by construction and saves small round-trips) and GATHER data rather than remove it. New tracking gate: watch the lock-bound exits (`runner_trail_bound='lock'`, armed shorts caught at +0.10) and read their post-exit path — if price keeps going the short's way after the +0.10 exit, the lock is cutting potential (consider lowering/disabling); if it reverses, the lock is earning its keep. Verdict on N≥4–5 lock-exits, from the CSV (no new instrumentation). Runner-exit stack back to ATR-floor(N=0.5) ∧ BE-ratchet(lock 0.10), no give-back cap. Supersedes the same-day disable entry above.

### 2026-06-18 — BUGFIX: flip runner-trail arm missing the 0.005pp float-tolerance (JTO near-arm dead zone)

Operator spotted JTO showing armed/at-a-level in the UI while open, yet the BE-ratchet didn't save it (peaked +0.4471%, rode to −1.04 SL). Root cause: the flip runner stretch-trail arm (trading_engine.py ~9073) used a STRICT `current_peak >= _sp_arm` (0.45), while the STANDARD trailing path (~8567) arms at `peak >= effective_tp_target − 0.005` (0.445) — a 0.005pp float-tolerance added May-6 precisely to avoid missing arms by a rounding hair (comment: "+0.4998 when tp_min 0.50 … strict >= would never arm"). So a peak in the 0.445–0.450 band armed the UI/standard logic but NOT the flip BE-ratchet → JTO (+0.4471) fell in that dead zone and got no lock. FIX: `if current_peak >= _sp_arm - 0.005:` — unifies the flip arm with the standard path. Chose the buffer over the operator's round-to-2dp suggestion (functionally identical here, but round() near .xx5 is float-/version-dependent via bankers rounding; the buffer is deterministic AND is the exact mechanism the standard path already uses). Verified: 0.4471→armed, 0.4449→not, 0.45/1.73→armed. Effect on JTO: +0.10 lock instead of −1.04 SL (+1.1% swing) AND the flip arm no longer disagrees with the UI. Correctness/consistency fix (not edge-mining); the buffer is already the validated codebase standard. trading_engine.py only.

### 2026-06-18 — SHIP (operator): flip-SHORT BTC-30m-RSI-rising block + DISABLE PAIR_RSI_OB source

Disaster batch (06-18, flip net −$1521, HEALTHY_BULL 30%WR/−$604). Two actions.

(1) DISABLE PAIR_RSI_OB: `flip_entry_sources` "FAN_RATIO_GATE:1.0,PAIR_RSI_OB:1.0" → "FAN_RATIO_GATE:1.0". ✗ HARMFUL cross-batch (this batch N=18/28%WR/−$523, all HEALTHY_BULL, 72% SL-rate, no source filters). Phantom (`Pair RSI >65`) keeps seeding; re-enable only at WR≥60% & net-positive on N≥20.

(2) BTC-30m-RSI-rising block (`flip_short_btc30_rise_block_min=0.0`): block flip-SHORT when (entry_btc_rsi − entry_btc_rsi_prev6) > 0 = BTC 30m RSI rising. THE cleanest cross-batch differentiator found this session. Method: among the 33 FLIP_STOP_LOSS L1 losers, 32/33 NEVER ARMED (peak ~0.15) → an ENTRY problem, not exit (N/trail irrelevant). Continuous indicators showed NO SL-loss-vs-win separation (RSI 57.6 vs 57.8, ADXΔ −0.20 vs −0.18, stretch 0.51 vs 0.45). Pair-RSI direction FLIPPED across batches (rising +$668 yest → −$1128 today = noise). But BTC-30m-RSI direction was STABLE & strong in BOTH batches (FAN-only): rising −$1031 (today −$965, yest −$66) vs falling +$811 (today −$33, yest +$844); win−loss gap +$910/+$932 both days. Corroborated by the report's per-regime BTC-30m tables (bear: Falling −$39 vs Rising −$990). Mechanism: BTC 30m rising = macro bouncing → the faded parabolic pump squeezes; falling = pump exhausts → short pays. Re-sim: TODAY −$998→−$33, YESTERDAY +$778→+$844. Engine: block in _flip_filters SHORT-gated (reason FLIP_SHORT_BTC30_RISE), added btc_rsi_prev6 to _ff_in (from entry_fields / _current_btc_rsi_prev6 global); D11 wired (config + json + UI emerald row + load/save). Sim-verified on both batches. DISCIPLINE: 2 windows (below ≥3 bar), operator-directed — but it's the rare cross-batch-STABLE signal (everything else flipped) + clean mechanism. Halves the flip-short count (only short when BTC 30m rolls over). CONFIRM/REVERT: raise threshold or disable (min=99) if BTC-30m-falling shorts go net-negative OR the rising cohort flips to ≥55% WR on N≥10 fresh. Note: 2× FAN multiplier KEPT per operator (excluded from this analysis). Trail-improvement (strpk/cap beats atr05 by +$90-210 on armed runners) noted but NOT shipped — separate follow-up.

### 2026-06-18 — CONFIG (operator-directed): DISABLE the SHORT BE-ratchet (lock)

Reverses the same-day "keep it ON and gather data" decision once the data came in. `runner_trail_short_be_ratchet_enabled` true→false. Clarified first the operator's confusion ("aren't we already on strpk?") — YES, strpk/ATR-floor is the live trail; my earlier "switch the trail to strpk" was a misstatement, there's nothing to switch. The actual point: the +0.10 lock sits ON TOP of strpk and over-tightens it; disabling it just lets the existing trail do its job. EVIDENCE (15-42-03 batch, the 6 armed lock-exits = `runner_trail_bound='lock'`, all in the post-filter KEPT set): under the operator's framing that a loser can't drop past the −1.20 SL (so the lock's max credit is +0.10 vs −1.20 = +1.30/trade), the held-with-strpk outcome (`shadow_strpk`, the stretch-trail WITHOUT the lock) banked +0.37 to +0.83 on ALL 6 — 0 saved / 6 cut runners, net −2.35pp. WHY it inverts the earlier "the lock saves disasters" read: (a) the −1.20 cap removes the catastrophe upside the lock was credited with (HU/AGT −5.5/−5.9 → capped −1.20); (b) more importantly, the strpk TRAIL exits those reversers at +0.44/+0.47 BEFORE the crash, so the lock's "saves" only beat a no-trail baseline — with strpk live they're redundant AND too tight (banks +0.10 while the runner re-runs). Full-stack re-sim of 15-42-03: raw −$1521 → entry filters −$33 → +BE-off +$85 (the 6 lock-exits re-price +$118: TAC +$37, SYN +$34 lead). REVERT GATE (replaces the prior "+0.10 round-trip tracking" gate): re-enable if over N≥8 fresh armed SHORT reversers the no-lock book bleeds past −0.70 vs the `shadow_atr05` no-ratchet control. Caveat: N=6/one-batch + `shadow_strpk` is a model not realized fills → TIGHT gate. trading_config.json only (D11 already wired). Runner-exit stack now: ATR-floor(N=0.5) ONLY.

### 2026-06-18 — INVESTIGATED, NO CHANGE: BTC-30m-RSI-rising threshold (keep `>0`)

Operator asked whether tightening `flip_short_btc30_rise_block_min` from 0 to a higher cut (e.g. >+3) could spare yesterday's fat-tail winner BRUSDT (+$544/+1.81%, the prechange-39 batch's biggest flip winner, cut by the rising block) while still saving today's losers. My own "marginal riser" suggestion — KILLED by the data: BR's Δ(entry_btc_rsi − entry_btc_rsi_prev6) = **+10.60**, one of the STEEPEST risers in the batch, not marginal. To spare BR you'd need T>+10.6, which keeps essentially the entire rising cohort and forfeits the ~+$965 today-save. Threshold sweep (block SHORT if Δ>T) on both batches: 2-batch net effect peaks at T≈0.5–1.5 (+$767) and DECLINES monotonically as you tighten (T=3 → +$274, T=5 → +$315) — today's losers leak back faster than yesterday's winners recover; yesterday's winner-cut doesn't even drop until T=4. VERDICT: `>0` is within noise of optimal (T=0.5–1.5 buys a trivial +$8). BR is an irreducible fat-tail sacrifice — the priced-in cost of blocking a cohort that is net −$1k+/batch. No config change. Honest framing for the record: this filter WILL occasionally kill a steep-rising fat-tail winner like BR; the threshold cannot separate it from the losers (same regime, same steep-rising signature).

### 2026-06-18 — SHIP (operator): Entry-Funnel REAL cap-cost counter (normal vs flip)

Operator asked to see, in the "Blocked at max-5 (no trade lost)" box, how many NORMAL vs FLIP trades the 5-cap turns away, and whether the 1,417 figure is even correct. DIAGNOSIS: 1,417 is the WRONG metric — `blocked_at_max` counts filter-rejections that happen DURING full-book scans (a scan-start `_scan_had_room_snapshot`, per-cycle inflated), NOT trades the cap actually prevented; the genuine "the 5-cap turned away a ready signal" event (open_position max-pos gate, line ~3271) was NEVER counted (just `return None`). FIX: new in-memory `_cap_skip_counts {normal, flip}` (trading_engine.py ~900), incremented at that gate keyed `"flip" if flip_source else "normal"`. Exposed in main.py `entry_funnel` (real + exception-fallback dicts) as `cap_skip_normal`/`cap_skip_flip`; rendered as a subline on the Blocked-at-max box (templates/index.html ~11382) + BOTH text-report exports (~8583 clipboard, ~10374 saved-file) per D12 (grep-verified render+2 exports). CAVEAT baked into the design: still per-scan (a ready signal re-counts each cycle while full) → read RELATIVE (normal-vs-flip ratio, trend), not absolute distinct trades — but it's the CORRECT event now (a tradeable signal the cap stopped), not filter-noise-while-full. USE: answers the "raise positions 5→10/15?" question with data — expect flip≫normal and good-cohort skips LOW. Companion finding (this batch): the filtered good cohort runs ~0.3 concurrent positions vs the 5-cap (23 trades/12h @ ~11min) → the cap is NOWHERE near binding on the good trades → do NOT raise max-positions (the 1,417 pressure was the now-entry-filtered bad cohort). 3 files (trading_engine.py + main.py + templates/index.html).

### 2026-06-18 — SHIP (operator): open the fan 3-10 flip band (trade clean high-fan exhaustion, block only the parabolic gappers)

Operator-directed, from a deep fan-ratio analysis. TWO config edits, one thesis. (1) `flip_fan_spike_max` 5.0→10.0 — the spike veto now fires only at fan≥10. (2) `fan_ratio_block_long` "0.85-3.00,5.0-99" → "0.85-99.0" — longs blocked (→ flip seeded) contiguously from fan 0.85 up, closing the 3.0-5.0 gap. NET: flips now trade fan 0.85-10.0 (added 3-5, which NEVER seeded before, + 5-10, which seeded-then-vetoed); fan 10+ stays blocked.

WHY. (a) Operator caught my error: I claimed fan 3-5 was "already allowed, just hadn't fired" — WRONG. Verified in code: a flip is born ONLY from a blocked long (`_maybe_open_flip` inside the FAN_RATIO_GATE block path; `_flip_filters` can only veto/size an existing flip, never create one). The live block band was "0.85-3.00,5.0-99", so fan 3.0-5.0 was structurally unreachable — 0 of 145 FAN flips ever landed there (confirmed across 5 batches). (b) The fan 3-5 phantom row (+0.281%/73% WR aligned/N=19) is the A/B CONTROL stream (PASS:FAN_RATIO_GATE = fades of longs that passed at 3-5) — exactly the evidence for whether to add the band, and it pays. (c) Gap-risk reconsidered by magnitude: the 3 high-fan losers were ASTER 5.7→−0.69 (clean −0.70, no gap), ALLO 13.2→−1.20 (gapped to floor), VELVET 28.3→−1.20 (gapped). The catastrophic SL-gap kicks in at fan ~13+, NOT at 5 — so 3-10 is the clean exhaustion-fade band and only 10+ truly gaps. Confound test: of the 3 losers 2 were BTC-30m rising (now filtered separately) but ALLO was FALLING and still gapped → fan carries independent gap-risk, so we keep the 10+ block rather than unblock entirely. Normal-long impact of the block extension is negligible (bot is ~flip-only: 3 normal vs 66 flips/batch) and thesis-consistent (high-fan longs = late/over-extended). trading_config.json only (existing fields). DISCIPLINE: phantom/control-derived + partly in-sample → TIGHT revert gate. LOCKED REVERT: revert BOTH (spike_max→5, block_long→"0.85-3.00,5.0-99") if fan 3-10 fresh flips show WR≤50% OR avg≤+0.05% on N≥10, OR ≥2 of the first 5 gap past −1.0%. Read surface = the Fan-Ratio Curve live rows + the flip log by fan bucket.

### 2026-06-18 — ANALYSIS (no change): max-open-positions 5→8 considered, DEFERRED to the cap-skip counter

Operator asked whether to raise max positions 5→8 since the recent filters trade "very little" at 5. ANALYSIS → not yet, and the framing is a trap. (1) MECHANIC: `equal_split` sizes each trade = balance/max_positions (engine line 1859), so 5→8 SHRINKS every bet 37.5% — it does NOT add fills. Gross leverage at full book is constant either way (no ruin-risk argument for or against). (2) BINDING? The "1,417 Blocked at max-5" that motivates the ask is the WRONG metric (filter-rejections during full-book scans, not signals the cap turned away); the REAL cap-cost is the new `_cap_skip_counts` counter, which reads 0 (no fresh data). Historically the book ran ~0.3 concurrent positions (23 trades/12h × ~11min) — the cap was never binding. (3) RIGHT LEVER: "trade more" is a SUPPLY problem (just addressed via the fan 3-10 add), not a cap problem — equal_split can't manufacture trades, it only slices thinner. DECISION: run one fresh batch with the new fan supply, read the cap-skip counter. Raise only if flip cap-skips are HIGH and the sleeve is net-positive, and then modestly (5→6/7, one step) — never blind to 8. Caveat worth watching: fan-spike fades cluster (market-wide pumps), so the new supply is the type that could start binding — hence measure, don't assume. No config change.

### 2026-06-18 — SHIP (operator): BULL_LONG entry sleeve (build-side long) + Bull-Long Curve observation table

First LIVE long-build sleeve. Genesis: PASS:FAN_RATIO_GATE LONG (the longs that PASS the fan gate, tracked same-direction in the Source×Regime bull-hunt) pays strongly in HEALTHY_BULL — cross-POOL validated: pre-reset 34/79%/+0.33 and post-reset 18/94%/+0.49 (combined H.BULL ~52/84%/+0.39), with a STABLE S.BULL exclusion (22% then 20% WR — loses both pools). Thin live corroboration: the 2 live unmatched longs this batch (1000PEPE/ADA) were HEALTHY_BULL, both won (+0.69 avg). Phantom→live haircut ~0.25% (fees 0.063-0.09 gross + slippage) → ~+0.14% live net floor; but the live sleeve uses the NORMAL long exit (per-level trailing) which BEAT the flat phantom model on those 2 examples, so realized expected ABOVE +0.33.

WHAT SHIPPED. `entry_strategy="BULL_LONG"` — a REAL momentum long (NOT a fade, NOT _is_flip → rides the normal long exit stack: per-level trailing / ATR-widened SL / EMA13-off-for-longs / no 45min cap). Fires at the fan-gate-PASS site (FAN_CONTROL else branch) via `_maybe_open_bull_long` (fail-silent, mirrors `_maybe_open_flip`); self-gates: bull_long_enabled AND fan_ratio < bull_long_fan_max(0.85) AND entry_btc_regime ∈ bull_long_regimes("HEALTHY_BULL") AND per-pair/30min cooldown. BYPASSES the downstream long filters (long_unmatched_only + pattern-cell block) to match the naked phantom population (the +0.33 was measured on the passthrough); all HARD risk controls (max-open, one-per-pair, cooldown, liquidity/gross-lev caps) still enforced inside open_position. Multipliers `bull_long_size_mult`/`bull_long_lev_mult` built from scratch, DEFAULT 1.0/1.0 = NO amplification, normal STRONG_BUY 20× leverage (operator: "same leverage, 1 as multiplier"). cell_src "BULL_LONG" → own row in Multiplier Cell Performance.

OBSERVATION TABLES (D12, UI + both exports). ① 📈 Bull-Long Trade Log (live scorecard, after the Flip Trade Log) — N/WR/avg/Total$/Size×/Lev×/Δ$-1× + ×BTC-Regime row + VERDICT BUILDING n/15. ② 📈 Bull-Long Curve — virtual longs (PASS + new BLOCK:FAN_RATIO_GATE seeds) by fan bucket × regime, flat-model phantom as a CONSISTENT comparator (not absolute) to map whether the H.BULL edge is fan-dependent or fan-agnostic. THE EXPANSION LOOP: the curve's axes ARE the config dials — if H.BULL wins at all fan buckets → raise `bull_long_fan_max`→99 (drop the fan gate); if CHOP/H.BEAR win → add to `bull_long_regimes`. Widen by config, no code. Post-Exit Regret already includes BULL_LONG (inclusive by close-reason). D11: 5 fields fully plumbed (config.py + json + UI input/load/save). Built by mirroring the flip; entry path reviewed line-by-line + AST/JSON/grep verified.

LOCKED REVERT GATE (phantom-derived + single-regime-window → TIGHT): disable (`bull_long_enabled`=false) if at live N≥15 the sleeve shows WR≤55% OR avg≤+0.05% net. INSTANT review if 3 of the first 6 hit SL, OR if live−phantom gap > 0.25%/trade (the PAIR_RSI_OB failure mode). Do NOT raise the multiplier off 1.0 until live clears WR≥70% & avg≥+0.10% on N≥30. RISK: bypassing downstream long filters is the real exposure (some may have protected against bad longs the phantom didn't see) — the N≥15 gate is the backstop; the regime gate means it can't bleed outside HEALTHY_BULL (just stops firing). 5 files (config.py + trading_config.json + services/trading_engine.py + main.py + templates/index.html).

### 2026-06-18 — BUGFIX (operator-caught): BULL_LONG fired on the WRONG population — corrected to the validated blocked-long zone + fan_max 0.85→5.0

The BULL_LONG sleeve shipped earlier today was wired to the WRONG branch. ROOT CAUSE: `PASS:FAN_RATIO_GATE LONG` (the validated edge, H.BULL 94% WR) is NOT "longs that passed the fan gate" — it's the "un-block hunt": a long the fan gate BLOCKED (fan ≥ 0.85), tracked as a virtual long ("what if we un-blocked it"). Both I (spec) and the build agent misread "PASS" as "passed the gate" and wired the live `_maybe_open_bull_long` into the fan-PASSED else-branch (fan < 0.85) — a rare, UNVALIDATED population. Operator caught it ("nothing below 0.85?" — the Bull-Long Curve's 0-0.85 bucket was empty because passed longs are rare; all 37 validated longs sit at fan 0.85+). The sleeve as shipped barely fired and, when it did, traded the wrong longs. Near-zero live damage (fan<0.85 longs rare → ~0 opens). FIX (3 parts): (1) moved the live open to the BLOCKED branch (fires on blocked longs, the validated population), right beside the flip-fade hook; (2) `bull_long_fan_max` 0.85→5.0 — now the UPPER fan bound of the traded blocked-zone (H.BULL edge runs 0.85-5; nothing above 5), so it fires on blocked longs fan 0.85..5 in HEALTHY_BULL; (3) the bull-long now PRE-EMPTS the flip-short fade (`_maybe_open_bull_long` returns the Order; if it opened, skip `_maybe_open_flip`) — same blocked-long event was triggering BOTH a flip-SHORT and a bull-LONG (opposite positions racing for the one-per-pair slot); today they're mutually exclusive only because FLIP_SHORT_REGIME vetoes H.BULL shorts, but the pre-empt makes it robust. Also cleaned the muddied seeds (removed the subagent's redundant BLOCK:FAN_RATIO_GATE double-seed + the passed-branch PASS pollution) so the Bull-Long Curve = the clean blocked-long pool. Curve config-driven LIVE marker (✓ = fan < bull_long_fan_max) + a TOTAL footer row (per-regime summatory, operator-requested) added. Revert gate UNCHANGED (live N≥15: WR≤55%/avg≤+0.05% → disable). 5 files. AST/JSON/grep verified; entry branch re-read line-by-line post-fix.

### 2026-06-20 — ANALYSIS (no change, operator: keep collecting): FAN flip-short loser-separator hunt — all 6 candidates rejected cross-batch; sleeve is ~zero-edge fat-tailed coin flip

Operator asked, over a long session, to find a clean winner/loser separator for the FAN flip-short sleeve (`entry_strategy="FLIP:FAN_RATIO_GATE"`, SHORT, 20×) after a brutal run (last-6h −$937 on batch scalpars_orders_paper_2026-06-20_13-13-05). Tested 6 candidate entry filters on FAN flip-shorts across 3 batches (Jun17 prechange +$1039 N=28 / Jun18 postfan −$998 N=48 / Jun20 −$20 N=50). De-muxed to 1×, CLOSED only, dedup (opened_at,pair,direction). EVERY candidate failed the cross-batch / anti-overfit gates:

- **U1 (BTC vol<0.15 × BTC ADX>30):** Jun17 cut 11 (6W/5L) Δ−$335 (destroys winning-batch profit), Jun18 Δ+$9, Jun20 Δ+$533. Over-blocks normal conditions; the same low-vol×hi-ADX signature was a +$335 WINNER in Jun17.
- **U2 (pair ADX falling [entry_adx_delta<0] × BTC ADX rising [entry_btc_adx−entry_btc_adx_prev>0]):** best live precision (last-6h cut 6, 1W/5L, −$566; catches RIF/BICO/HEI that U3 misses) and soundest mechanism (divergence — pair losing downside momentum while BTC trend strengthens up → squeezes the fade). BUT Jun17 cut 6 (4W/2L) Δ−$31, Jun18 cut 12 (8W/4L) Δ+$13 — cut 2:1 WINNERS for ≈$0 in both out-of-sample batches. Loser-fraction 33%/33%/54% → only loser-heavy in its derivation batch = flags regime, not outcome.
- **U3 (BTC vol<0.10 = "Performance by BTC Volatility Regime (ATR%) <0.10%" bucket = entry_btc_atr_pct<0.10):** 0 trades in BOTH prior batches (the <0.10 BTC-vol regime didn't occur → literally unvalidatable, 1-episode; prior reports' BTC-Vol-Regime tables have no <0.10 row, lowest bucket 0.10-0.15). Also LEAKY: misses the 3 biggest last-6h losers (RIF −151/BICO −145/HEI −134 sit at vol 0.103-0.107, just above the line — −$430 escapes). Adjacent 0.10-0.15 band FLIPS SIGN cross-batch (Jun17 bearish +$876 / Jun18 −$344) → low BTC vol is not a stable loser signal. Operator correctly flagged U3 as a bad recommendation (I had wrongly framed "0 prior trades / near-zero footprint" as safe insurance — it's the signature of no demonstrated edge; retracted).
- **U4 (BTC ADX 30-35):** pooled curve <22 +$387 / 22-26 +$154 / 26-30 +$389 / **30-35 −$1077** / 35-40 +$304 = non-monotonic mid-range hole flanked by winners (locked-rule confound). Expressed as honest threshold BTC ADX≥30 it FLIPS sign (Jun17 −$477 = those were winners). ~78% of the 30-35 loss is 6 singleton fat-tails.
- **U5 (pair ADX 22-25):** N=8-10/batch; U2∪U3 already kills 7 of 10 (−$595 of −$635). Only incremental loser is ORDI −$128, at the cost of cutting INJ +$34 & NEAR +$53 (1L/2W) → pure redundancy + winner-bleed.

- **U2 ∪ U3 together (the build we were about to wire):** current batch cut 24/50 = 48% of the sleeve, 11W/13L, Δ+$906 (keep N=26, 81% WR, +$886); last-6h cut 16/17 → leaves −$12. BUT prior batches Δ−$31 / +$13 cutting mostly winners (U3=0 there, so it's U2-alone). Catches 16/17 of the live disaster only because the last 6h was ~all losers — it identifies the regime, not winners-vs-losers within it (still cut 6 winners). Best candidate found, but fails the same out-of-sample test (winner-heavy precision in the two honest batches). If ever shipped → only as an explicit unvalidated mechanism bet (discipline-override) with a tight revert (revert if next ≥15 blocked trades come back net-positive).

PER-PAIR concentration (CLAUDE.md mandatory check): current-batch loss diffuse — top-2 pairs (MET −$301 / HEI −$251) = 41% < 60% blacklist threshold; rest singletons. Cross-batch NO pair is a consistent loser: VELVET/JTO/XLM/XPL/SKYAI each WON ≥1 batch; this batch's worst (MET, HEI) have 0 prior history (1-batch). → no pair-blacklist either.

SCOPE: U3-for-all-flips evaluated and REJECTED — on PAIR_RSI_OB (0.05×, S.BULL) U3 fires on 14/26 (54%) for ±$7; that sleeve has no 20×-gap mechanism and its real losses (Jun18 −$523) were at vol 0.13-0.15. If anything ships → FAN-flip-only.

CORE FINDING: the FAN flip-short sleeve is a ~ZERO-EDGE fat-tailed coin flip — pooled +$1039 −$998 −$20 = +$21 net / 126 trades, avg ≈−0.005%/trade; the bearish Winners-vs-Losers table shows no entry separator (BTC RSI 40.5 vs 35.8, ATR 0.96 vs 1.08, pADX 20.7 vs 21.0). You cannot filter a coin flip into an edge — which is why all 6 candidates + regime + pair all overfit. The ONLY factor consistent across all 3 batches is the 20× gap-through-SL mechanism (FLIP_STOP_LOSS L1 slips −0.70 → −1.0/−1.2%). DE-LEVER quantified (pure $ scaling, leverage-invariant — %/trade unchanged): last-6h −$937 → −$469 @10× → −$234 @5×; worst single loss −$167 → −$84 → −$42. De-lever is ruin-risk control, NOT an expectancy fix (sleeve stays ~0). RECOMMENDATION made to operator: pause the FAN flip-short sleeve or cut it to ~5× rather than ship any entry filter. OPERATOR DECISION: do nothing now, keep collecting data (declined the proposed 20×→1× de-lever AND all 6 filters). All 6 candidates + U2∪U3 logged to CURRENT_STATE watchlist for re-evaluation at N≥2 fresh batches or the next low-BTC-vol grind episode. No code, config, or leverage change made.

ADDENDUM (same session, 2 more variables evaluated per operator request):

ADXΔ (pair ADX delta = entry_adx_delta), FAN flip-short, 3 batches — block ADXΔ<−0.5 Δnet: Jun17 cut 12(5W/7L,−$644) +$644 (keep +$1683) / Jun18 cut 19(12W/7L,−$527) +$527 / Jun20 cut 22(11W/11L,−$687) +$687. **THE ONLY candidate net-positive on ALL 3 batches including the winning Jun-17** — no sign flip; both loser sub-buckets negative all 3 (<−1.0 −$259/−$495/−$167 · −1.0..−0.5 −$385/−$31/−$520); −0.5..0 mixed (+$213/−$84/+$366) → cut at −0.5 not 0. Mechanism: flips bypass the live `Pair ADX Dir S: rising` filter → enter on collapsing pair-ADX (no momentum). PROMOTED to TOP re-eval candidate (above U2∪U3) in CURRENT_STATE. CAVEATS: (a) trips the locked "high-WR-but-net-losing → fix sizing not block" rule on Jun-18 (cut cohort 63% WR, cuts 12 winners); (b) it is the 2026-06-17 ADXΔ<−0.5 candidate already DOWNGRADED — BE-ratchet rescues the armed reversers, residual = never-armed straight-to-SL = the same 20× gap fat-tails (PORTAL/XLM/NEAR repeats). GATE: ship `flip_adx_delta_min=-0.5` (discipline-override+tight revert) at N≥30 ONLY IF cut stays net-neg AND ≤50% WR AND residual not 1-2 repeat pairs; else it's a sizing/de-lever fix.

Pair EMA13-EMA50 gap (entry_pair_ema20_ema50_gap_pct, misnamed — engine stores (ema13−ema50)/ema50), FAN flip-short — FAN flips INVERT the normal pair-trend filter. Live PAIR_TREND_FILTER blocks NORMAL shorts at gap≥0; flips want the opposite: gap≥0 (extended-up) non-losing all 3 (+$233/−$77/+$49), gap<0 (downtrend) is the disaster side — BUT gap<0 was the +$806 profit engine in Jun-17, so blocking it kills the winning batch (overfit trap). Only cross-batch-consistent sub-cell = gap 0–1.0 (positive all 3: 0-0.5 +0.05/+0.31/+0.32, 0.5-1.0 +0.44/+0.49/+0.27); gap>1.0 over-extended = consistent small loser (−$227/−$342, overlaps fan-spike). Mechanistic insight (flips need opposite trend condition), watchlist not ship. Both logged to CURRENT_STATE 2026-06-20 block. Still no code/config/leverage change.

### 2026-06-20 — SHIP (operator N=9/N=15 DISCIPLINE-OVERRIDE): PAIR_RSI_OB ADX≥33 floor + lev 1×→20×, AND BULL_LONG fan 1.65–3.00 + lev 1×→20×

Two operator-directed ships, both N<30 + a straight 1×→20× leverage jump (skipping the locked 1.5×-first Phase-3 staging). I flagged both as hard discipline-overrides against the locked multiplier gate (N≥30, staged) + this session's own finding that 20× counter-trend fades are the gap-through-SL disaster profile; operator chose full 20× on both via AskUserQuestion ("Full 20× now (override)"). Shipped with tight reverts.

(1) PAIR_RSI_OB (overbought-fade short). ① `flip_pair_rsi_ob_adx_min=33.0` — new config field; engine gate added in the PAIR_RSI_OB branch of `_flip_filters` (AFTER the regime gate), block when entry pair ADX < 33 → counter `FLIP_PAIR_RSI_OB_ADX` (auto-recorded via the existing flip `_record_filter_block(_reason, flip_dir)` path). ② `flip_entry_sources` PAIR_RSI_OB lev_mult `0.05→1.0` = full 20× (was 1× de-risked obs). EVIDENCE (live, N=9): PAIR_RSI_OB × Pair ADX bucket 33+ = 9/89%WR/+0.58%/+$698; every bucket <33 net-negative (18-22 −$75, 22-25 −$138, 25-28 −$163, 28-30 −$76, 30-33 −$91) → the fade pays only on a blow-off in a strongly-trending pair. The ADX≥33 floor restricts firing to the one winner cell, partly offsetting the 20× risk. D11 full: config.py default+comment, trading_config.json, engine gate, templates/index.html (input `config-flip-pair-rsi-ob-adx-min` + load + save, grep-verified 1/1/1). TIGHT REVERT: set `flip_pair_rsi_ob_adx_min`→0 and/or lev→0.05 at live N≥15 new PAIR_RSI_OB shorts if 33+ WR≤70% OR avg≤+0.05%; INSTANT de-lever if any single fade gaps SL past ~−1.0% OR 3 of first 6 hit FLIP_STOP_LOSS.

(2) BULL_LONG (build-side long). `bull_long_fan_min` 1.35→1.65, `bull_long_fan_max` 10.0→3.0, `bull_long_lev_mult` 0.05→1.0 (=20×). Existing fields (no new D11 — config.py defaults + trading_config.json values only; UI already wired). EVIDENCE (live Bull-Long × Fan): only 1.65-2.0 (5/80%/+$175) and 2.0-3.0 (10/90%/+$705) are positive; below 1.65 net-neg (0.85-1.0 −$419, 1.0-1.35 −$732, 1.35-1.65 −$120) and above 3.0 small-N losers (3-5 −$206, 5-10 −$130). The fan restriction is itself a risk reducer (cuts the documented losers, keeps the two winner bands = N=15); 20× then amplifies the filtered winner cell. CAVEAT: violates "ship one change at a time" (fan-min + fan-max + lev together); sleeve was net-LOSING overall (47/49%/−$352, H.BULL −$789 de-muxed) — the bet is the 1.65-3.00 sub-band's 80-90% WR holds live at 20×. Supersedes the prior BULL_LONG 1×-observation gate (its N≥15 revert had already tripped → this is the operator's hunt-the-2nd-variable resolution at 20×). TIGHT REVERT: de-lever `bull_long_lev_mult`→0.05 at live N≥15 new bull-longs if kept band WR≤70% OR avg≤+0.05%; INSTANT de-lever if 3 of first 6 SL OR any single gaps past ~−1.0%; widen fan back only if 1.65-3.00 holds AND adjacent bands turn positive on N≥30.

Validated: trading_config.json parses (bull_long fan 1.65/3.0/lev 1.0; pair_rsi_ob adx_min 33.0, sources …PAIR_RSI_OB:1.0:1.0); config.py + services/trading_engine.py AST-clean; UI ids 1/1/1. 5 files (config.py, trading_config.json, services/trading_engine.py, templates/index.html, CLAUDE_CURRENT_STATE.md). Both sleeves now run full 20× — the next batch's FLIP TRADES × BTC-REGIME (PAIR_RSI_OB row) and Bull-Long Trade Log are the make-or-break reads; watch the first 6 fires of each per the instant-de-lever triggers.

### 2026-06-20 — SHIP (operator): PAIR_RSI_OB ADX floor RAISED 33→40 + analytics retargeted to ADX≥40

Same-day follow-up after the split-bucket analytics (shipped earlier today) populated with live data. The ADX≥33 cell — which we'd shipped at 20× on N=9/89%/+$698 — had (a) DECAYED to 13/62%/+$431 (WR through the 70% revert line), and (b) split cleanly: 33-40 = N=5/20%WR/−$237 (a loser band) vs 40+ = N=8/88%WR/+$668. The edge is entirely ADX≥40. Operator raised `flip_pair_rsi_ob_adx_min` 33→40. I flagged this as a 2nd finer re-cut on a decaying cell (N=8 < the N=13 it replaces — re-optimizing to the latest snapshot = the overfit trap; my recommendation was to NOT re-cut but watch the revert gate / de-lever). Operator chose 40. Shipped with the same tight revert (now keyed to the 40+ cell: de-lever/disable at N≥15 if WR≤70% or avg≤+0.05%). RSI→70 was the alternative cut considered and rejected (it only removes the 65-70 breakeven band +$45, not the −$237 loser; ADX→40 dominates and likely subsumes it). Also retargeted the analytics: 🎯 PAIR_RSI_OB × Pair ADX now splits 33+ into 33-36/36-40/40-45/45+, and the ADX≥33×RSI cross-bucket became ADX≥40×RSI (key `adx33_rsi`→`adx40_rsi`, threshold ≥40, all UI titles + both exports + tbody id). config.py 40.0 default + comment; trading_config.json 40.0. Validated: floor=40.0, zero adx33 remnants, 3 ADX≥40 export blocks (1 UI title + 2 exports), main.py/config.py AST-clean. The honest note for next batch: this cell has now been re-cut twice on N≤13 — if the 40+ cohort doesn't hold ≥70% WR on the next ~5 live fires, de-lever (gate), do NOT slice a third time.

### 2026-06-20 PM — NO-SHIP (analysis): U3 (BTC vol<0.10) + MET deep-dive → resolved to one out-of-sample ship gate

Extended FAN flip-short investigation on the fresh batch (export 19-43-12 / 20-41-55, FAN flip-short N=60, net −$131.78). Operator hunted hard for a shippable loser-cut; the honest finding after exhaustive testing is that none survives the anti-overfit bar, and the whole thing resolves to a single forward-confirmation gate.

**The U3 reframe.** The dashboard "Performance by BTC Volatility Regime (ATR%)" table is the FAN flips sliced by `entry_btc_atr_pct` (verified: 13/34/12/1 = 60 trades, −$681.85/+$430.08/+$107.40/+$12.59 = −$131.78 exactly; pure FAN_RATIO_GATE, no entry-mixing — confirmed the row universe contains only that one strategy). So that table IS U3. It looks clean because the entire loss concentrates in one cell: **BTC ATR <0.10 = 13 trades, 38% WR, −$682; ≥0.10 = 47 trades, 68% WR, +$550.**

**Combined U3+MET on this batch:** block (BTC ATR<0.10 OR pair=MET) → cut 15 (5W/10L, −$788), keep 45 (32W/13L, 71% WR, +$656), Δ+$788 vs the −$132 baseline. MET's marginal contribution beyond U3 is just +$106 (2 MET trades survive U3; U3 already eats MET's two biggest −167/−122).

**Why every candidate is no-ship (all fail the same way — single-batch / in-sample):**
- Cross-batch footprint: U3 fired 0 in Jun-17, 0 in Jun-18, 13 in Jun-20. MET 0/0/4. HEI 0/0/5 (2W/3L). SAND 0/0/3 (1W/2L). None has a single out-of-sample data point. The +$656/+$788 is scored on the exact trades the rules were carved from → can only look good.
- Pair blacklists: only MET is all-loser (4/4, −$396); HEI and SAND have winners (HEI +$38/+$35, SAND +$65) so blacklisting them cuts winners. And per-concentration doctrine wants cross-batch consistency, which 0/0/N can't supply.
- Theory (the decisive kill on U3): the U3-cut losses are PAIR gaps while BTC was calm — cut losers had BTC ATR ~0.095 (median) yet closed −1.2% on pair ATR 0.6-1.25, and even genuinely calm pairs (ETC pair-ATR 0.22, XMR 0.37) hit the −0.70 SL. So BTC's volatility doesn't predict an individual alt's gap; the "low BTC vol = worse for shorts" reading is backwards from intuition AND the opposite of the table's own stated "high-ATR+low-ADX = violent chop" hypothesis → finding the reverse of your hypothesis in one sample = noise. Corrected a mischaracterization mid-analysis: pair-ATR 0.89 is normal-to-low, NOT "the alt was moving"; pair-ATR governs how far PAST the SL the loss overshoots, not WHETHER it loses — the loss is a wrong-direction fade amplified by 20×.

**Exhaustive separator search on the 47-trade U3-keep cohort (15 losers vs 32 winners) — nothing separates:**
- Every tracked indicator overlaps: pair-ADX 19.9 vs 20.1, ADXΔ −0.33 vs −0.60, pair-RSI 58.5 vs 57.0, BTC-ADX 27.5 vs 29.5, range-pos 75 vs 69, quality 2.19 vs 2.07 — all small, overlapping deltas.
- Filter combos within keep: ADXΔ<−0.5 cuts 14W/9L (kills more winners than losers); U1/U4 cut net-POSITIVE pockets (Δ negative); U5 (pADX 22-25) cut 4W/4L; the only high-loser-precision cut is ADXΔ∩U5 = 1W/4L (+$526) but that's an N=5 blocklist of the exact gappers (RIF/BICO/ORDI/BIO), three filters deep on a single batch.
- Pair-ATR is non-monotonic (losers at both 0.64 AND 2.8; the 0-0.50 cell is 9/9 winners = a winner pocket, not a loser cut). Pair-volume is non-monotonic and backwards (<$50M is net-POSITIVE +$229; cutting low-vol destroys value). Range-position 50-75% is the loser zone (−$595) but at 52% WR.
- The 15 losers share exactly one thing: each gapped through the −0.70% SL at 20× (closes −0.9% to −1.2%, scattered across every pair and regime, good and bad). No entry filter can see a gap that hasn't happened yet.

**Conclusion (unchanged from the session's core finding, now triple-confirmed — indicator scan, filter combinatorics, pair ATR/volume):** the FAN flip-short bleed is a leverage/tail problem, not an entry problem. The mechanism-true levers are on the tail (de-lever the sleeve, or per-trade cap), not entry filters or one-batch pair blacklists.

**SHIP GATE (operator-set, logged):** ship U3 (and/or a discretionary MET risk-blacklist — bounded downside, one microcap) the INSTANT the next batch fires sub-0.10 BTC ATR (or another MET flip) and LOSES again — that is the confirming out-of-sample sample we don't yet have. Until then: NO config change.

**Process decision: keep the run going, NO reset.** Out-of-sample validation = elapsed time + new fires, not a paper reset; the cross-batch dedup key `(opened_at, pair, direction)` is reset-proof by design (never uses `id`). Keeping the run preserves N and enables a clean before/after-today split for the forward test. Reset is purely a capital-hygiene lever — only if the paper balance falls low enough that position sizing degrades (balance ~$2,330, runway ~19.6h with emergency swaps firing, but workable). No FAN-sleeve config changed, so future FAN flips remain poolable with today's 60 for clean attribution. The 17:42/20:41 re-exports showed no new FAN fires yet (still 60/−$131.78) — not the confirming batch.

### 2026-06-20 PM — FIX (PAIR_RSI_OB ADX floor was a no-op) + SHIP U3 (FAN sub-0.10 weekend block, FAN-only)

Two engine changes, shipped together before an operator paper reset (pre-reset snapshot saved: reports/flip_ref_2026-06-20_presreset_22-31-57.csv + flip_2026-06-20_presreset_results.txt).

**FIX — `flip_pair_rsi_ob_adx_min` (the ADX≥40 floor) had never fired live.** The gate in `services/trading_engine.py` `_flip_filters` reads `ind.get('adx')` (pair ADX), but the `_ff_in` dict assembled at the call site (~line 3164) never populated a pair-`adx` key — it had `btc_adx`, `adx_delta`, `pair_rsi`, etc. but not `adx`. So `ind.get('adx')` returned None, the guard `if _ob_adx is not None and _ob_adx < _ob_amin` short-circuited, and every PAIR_RSI_OB short passed the floor regardless of pair ADX. The sleeve has been running fully unfiltered at 20× since the floor "shipped" (commit 840e913) — explaining the live fires at pADX 25-36 and the −$596 de-muxed bleed. Fix: added `'adx'` to `_ff_in`. Verified on the 22-31-57 batch: with the floor live, 35 of 43 PAIR_RSI_OB shorts (the pADX<40 fires, −$427) get blocked; the 8 at pADX≥40 stay (+$33, the 40-45/45+ winning band). Audit confirmed no OTHER key read by `_flip_filters` is missing from `_ff_in` (rsi/adx_prev1 matches were false positives on `btc_ind` in another function). The floor's tight-revert clock effectively starts now (first time the 40+ cohort is the only thing firing).

**SHIP — U3, FAN flip-short sub-0.10 BTC-ATR block, FAN-ONLY.** New config field `flip_fan_btc_atr_min = 0.10`: block FAN flip-short when entry BTC ATR% < 0.10. Gate placed inside the `source == "FAN_RATIO_GATE"` / `flip_dir == 'SHORT'` block (counter FLIP_FAN_LOATR; added `btc_atr_pct` to `_ff_in`). D11 complete: config.py default + evidence comment, trading_config.json (thresholds.flip_fan_btc_atr_min=0.10), engine gate, UI input (cyan "Block BTC ATR% <" in the FAN filters panel) + load + save; the filter-block counter rides the existing `_record_filter_block(_reason, flip_dir)` at the call site. Grep-verified: id `config-flip-fan-btc-atr-min` x3 (input/load/save), key present in all 4 files, py+json AST clean.

EVIDENCE: FAN sub-0.10 cell = N=14 / 36% WR / −$775, every loss a 20× straight-to-SL gap. Weekday batches Jun17 (Wed, BTC ATR min 0.109) and Jun18 (Thu, min 0.122) never dipped <0.10 → the regime is **weekend-only** (operator's day-of-week insight; thin weekend liquidity is the common cause of both quiet BTC and gappy alts). Meets the locked Pattern-C→FILTER gate on WR≤40%/Avg%≤−0.20%/NP≥60% — fails ONLY on N (14<30) and is ONE weekend. Shipped as a **discipline-override** (transparent, like PAIR_RSI_OB N=8 / BULL_LONG N=15).

SCOPE = FAN-ONLY, deliberately. The PAIR_RSI_OB sub-0.10 losers (AXS/AVAX/SOL, pADX 27-34) were the ADX-floor BUG above, not clean evidence — once the fix deploys they don't fire. There is zero clean evidence that a properly-filtered PAIR_RSI_OB short (pADX≥40, STRONG_BULL) loses sub-0.10, and it's a different macro regime (FAN's sub-0.10 losses are bear/chop). Don't stack two unproven rules on PAIR_RSI_OB. LONG_UNMATCHED has no data. Widen to universal only if a future weekend shows the other sleeves lose sub-0.10 on real (non-bug) fires.

TIGHT REVERT (N=14 / one-weekend override): set `flip_fan_btc_atr_min`→0 if next weekend's blocked-cohort sub-0.10 fades would have been ≥45% WR on N≥6 (track via the phantom flip tracker, which still observes the blocked side). Blocking FAN does not fully blind the regime test — PAIR_RSI_OB + phantom still fire/observe sub-0.10 next weekend.

Operator will reset paper after deploy for a clean post-change forward window (dedup is reset-proof).

### 2026-06-20 PM — SHIP: decouple PAIR_RSI_OB overbought-fade seed from the BTC_ADX_GATE_HIGH long veto (live, de-risked)

Operator-surfaced design defect: the PAIR_RSI_OB fade (overbought-long blocked at pair RSI>65 → fade SHORT, STRONG_BULL only) was structurally choked above BTC ADX 40. Root cause: the seed lives inside `_signal_block_recorder`, which early-returns whenever a BTC-macro gate vetoes the long (`_btc_macro_blocks_long is not None`). That guard exists for bookkeeping (Filter Blocks should show the decisive gate) + to not fade longs macro already killed — but it's an ACCIDENTAL inheritance for this sleeve: the fade is a SHORT, so the long's BTC-ADX ceiling is irrelevant to it, and overbought pairs are richest exactly when BTC trends hardest (ADX>40). Net effect was a contradiction — the flip's own regime gate WANTS STRONG_BULL (BTC ADX≥28, no upper bound) but the seed died above 40, squeezing the live window to BTC ADX [28,40] and excluding the strongest trends. At BTC ADX 51 the dashboard showed 7/7 long blocks = BTC_ADX_GATE_HIGH → zero seeds → no fades, even though regime/pADX gates would have passed.

FIX (new config field `flip_pair_rsi_ob_btc_adx_high_mode`, off/phantom/live, shipped **live**): when the long's SOLE macro veto is `BTC_ADX_GATE_HIGH` and mode≠off, the recorder seeds the fade THROUGH the veto (suppressing only the redundant pair-block count + decisive-reason stamp, so Filter Blocks stays honest). Phantom seeds always; the LIVE marker (`rsi_ob_flip`) is set only when mode==live. Scoped to BTC_ADX_GATE_HIGH ONLY — every other macro veto (BTC_TREND_FILTER, BTC_ADX_GATE_LOW, slope/cross) corresponds to a non-STRONG_BULL state the flip's own regime gate already rejects, so decoupling those would be wrong.

DE-RISK: the newly-unchoked BTC ADX>40 cohort has ZERO prior data (the seed was never allowed there), so `_flip_filters` returns lev **0.05 (1× eff)** for it (boundary = `btc_adx_max_long`, the same ceiling that defines the seed-through cohort) while the validated [28,40] cohort stays at **1.0 (20×)** — a per-cohort split, not a sleeve-wide de-risk (de-multiplying the just-shipped 20× cohort would chop a winner). PROMOTE the >40 cohort to full lev on its own evidence; the regime (STRONG_BULL) + pADX≥40 gates still apply to it downstream.

D11 full: config.py default "off" + evidence comment, trading_config.json "live", engine (recorder carve-out + `_flip_filters` de-risk; counters unchanged — these are normal PAIR_RSI_OB flips from a new regime), UI cyan select (off/phantom/live) + load + save. Grep-verified id ×3, key in all 4 files, py+json AST clean. REVERT: set mode→off if the >40 fades whipsaw (WR≤45% on N≥8). Note: builds on the same-day ADX-floor fix (the floor must be live for pADX≥40 to mean anything) — this is shipped after a paper reset, so the >40 cohort accrues from a clean window.

### 2026-06-21 — SHIP: PAIR_RSI_OB floor 40→45 + >40-BTC-ADX cohort promoted 1×→20× (N=17 override)

First post-reset batch (export 13-02-28) gave the first real read on the newly-decoupled BTC-ADX>40 PAIR_RSI_OB cohort. The de-risk worked exactly as intended: the 1× (>40) cohort ran N=32/66%WR/−$9 (vs −$182 it would have lost at full 20× — the de-risk saved ~$173). Verified the report's PAIR_RSI_OB × pADX table is correct: **40-45 = 17/47%WR/−$605 (de-mux), 45+ = 17/82%WR/+$347 (+0.20% avg)**. Per-trade in the 45+ band: only 1 of 17 gapped straight to SL (EPIC pADX 46.3); the other 2 losers ARMED (peaked +0.21 / +0.83) → **BE-compatibility = 67% (2/3 losers peak ≥+0.20%), clears the ≥60% lock** for lev-stacking. Mechanism: when BTC trends this hard (ADX 45-55 all batch) only the most extreme pair blow-offs (pADX≥45) mean-revert; 40-45 squeezes through.

CHANGES (operator-directed): ① `flip_pair_rsi_ob_adx_min` 40→**45** (config.py + json) — cut the 40-45 loser band sleeve-wide. ② Removed the de-risk in `_flip_filters` so the BTC-ADX>40 cohort fires at **full 20×** (was lev 0.05); all pADX≥45 STRONG_BULL now fires at 20× regardless of BTC ADX. `flip_pair_rsi_ob_btc_adx_high_mode` stays "live" (still gates the >40 SEED). UI helper text + mode tooltip/option updated (no new field — the floor input + mode select already exist).

DISCIPLINE: N=17/one-batch, below the N≥30 multiplier gate — explicit override (analyst recommended staging 1×→5×→20×; operator chose straight to 20×). The conceding point: the table is right and BE-compat passes, so it's not a confound; the risk is purely the thin N. **TIGHT REVERT: set `flip_pair_rsi_ob_btc_adx_high_mode`→off (stops the >40 seed entirely) AND/OR floor→40 if the next ~6-8 fresh 45+ fires drop below ~65% WR, OR a gap cluster (≥2 straight-to-SL) hits at 20×, OR BE-compat falls <60%.** py+json AST clean; de-risk return removed (grep 0).

NOT shipped this commit: the FAN flip-short fix (analysis below) — operator asked to finish the analysis first.

### 2026-06-21 — ANALYSIS (no ship): FAN flip-short positive-expectancy lever = block BTC-slope<0 × BTC-ADX 30-35

Finished the cross-batch (J17/18/20/21) hunt for a FAN flip-short divider across the three slope tables. Winner: the **BTC Slope × BTC ADX cross-tab**. The cell **BTC EMA20 slope <0 × BTC ADX 30-35** is negative in ALL FOUR batches (J17 −488, J18 −174, J20 −410, J21 −169; pooled N=60/53%WR/−$1241) — the most cross-batch-consistent FAN loser found to date. Mechanism: don't fade a pop when the market is TRENDING (ADX 30-35 bear = strong downtrend, the faded pop is a violent squeeze that gaps the 20× SL); the fade pays only when the market RANGES (BTC slope<0 × ADX<30 = +$766/71%, positive 3/3). Counterfactual (block the 30-35 cell): every batch improves — J17 +1039→+1527, J18 −998→−825, J20 −225→+185, J21 −287→−118; **pooled −$471 → +$770**. It is surgical: it does NOT touch J17's winners (the broader "block ADX≥30" cut sacrifices J17's +964 35-40 fat winner → worse). Regime-scope alternative (block STRONG_BEAR/BEAR_EXH/CHOP, keep H.BEAR) also flips pooled positive (+$653) BUT cuts $882 of J17 PROFIT (J17 STRONG_BEAR was +$552) — too coarse; the 2D cell is cleaner. CAVEAT: even after the block, J18 stays −$825 (its losers are outside the cell) — so this improves the sleeve and likely flips expectancy positive (clears N≥30 + all-4-batch consistency) but is not a guaranteed-positive-every-batch fix. BONUS (separate, multiplier candidate): pair EMA20 slope 0.20-0.30 = N=27/67%/+0.354%/+$1097, positive 3/3. PENDING operator decision to ship the BTC-slope<0×ADX-30-35 block (new `_flip_filters` gate; FAN-scoped).

### 2026-06-21 — SHIP: FLIP_SHORT_PAIR_GAP (pair EMA13-EMA50 gap≥1.0 block) + ADX×RSI table 40→45 retitle + negative-gap dig (NO-SHIP)

**Ship 1 — FLIP_SHORT_PAIR_GAP `flip_short_pair_gap_max=1.0` (commit 62d2d3b, pushed).** Block flip-SHORT when pair (EMA13−EMA50)/EMA50% ≥ 1.0. Replaces the BTC-gap×ADX-30-35 plug as the FAN-short loser cut. PROVENANCE: systematic survivor-pool scan (filter-overlap audit applied FIRST — current stack incl. U3/RSI<55/btc30-rise/regime) over winner-vs-loser separators showed the losers are defined by PAIR extension, not BTC state (losing FAN survivors: pair-ATR 1.38 vs 0.99, pair EMA13-50 gap +0.44 vs +0.12). Bucketing the gap gave a clean monotonic cliff: 0–0.3=+0.36, 0.3–0.6=+0.47, 0.6–1.0=+0.51 (87%WR sweet spot), then **≥1.0 = 16/44%WR/−0.359%avg/Σ−$461**, net-negative every batch it fires (J18 5/40%/−$168, J20 10/50%/−$172, J21 1/0%/−$121). Mechanism: fading a pair already steeply above its own 4h trend = shorting a parabola that keeps ripping → never arms (0.45 peak) → 20× gaps the ATR-widened SL to ~−1.2%. ONE-SIDED by design: operator asked re symmetric |gap| — tested and REJECTED. Full spectrum: extreme NEGATIVE gap is the BEST bucket (≤−1.5 = 3/67%/+0.79%) because a negative gap = pair in a downtrend = the short is WITH-trend momentum, not a fade. Symmetric |gap|≥1.0 keeps +$1,172 vs one-sided's +$1,401 (throws away the negative-side winners incl J17 +$175). gap≥1.0 SUBSUMES the ATR≥2.0 loser cohort (all 10 ATR≥2.0 ⊂ gap≥1.0) and overlaps the old gap×ADX plug only 2/16 → bigger, cleaner, more mechanistic. Pool effect: survivor FAN 68%/+0.095% → 74%/+0.220%/+$1,401. N=16 < the N≥30 Pattern-C gate (WR 44% not ≤40, never-pos 56% not ≥60) → DISCIPLINE-OVERRIDE, justified because BE is OFF so the −1.2% tails can't be capped (block is the only lever, not de-size), mechanism is sound (anti-parabola, the flip-side of the live non-flip pair_trend_short filter tuned for flips), and it's direction-consistent across 3 batches. Engine: new shared flip-SHORT block in `_flip_filters` (after FLIP_SHORT_RSI_MIN; counter FLIP_SHORT_PAIR_GAP); **`pair_gap` added to `_ff_in`** (= entry feature `entry_pair_ema20_ema50_gap_pct`, fallback (ema13−ema50)/ema50 from `_ind`) — guarded against the silent no-op trap that bit the PAIR_RSI_OB ADX floor. PAIR_RSI_OB returns early → unaffected (correct; it's a different setup). D11 full (config.py default 1.0 + evidence comment, trading_config.json 1.0, engine input+filter, templates input id `config-flip-short-pair-gap-max` + _setVal load + save payload). TIGHT REVERT: `flip_short_pair_gap_max`→0 if blocked gap≥1.0 flip-shorts hit ≥50% WR on N≥10 fresh (phantom/passthrough still observes the blocked side).

**Ship 2 — ADX≥40×RSI cross-bucket table retitled to ADX≥45 (reporting-only).** The live PAIR_RSI_OB floor was raised 40→45 in b4b3db1, but the 🎯 ADX×RSI analytics table still computed/labeled ≥40. Changed `main.py` threshold `entry_adx >= 40` → `>= 45`, renamed the response key `adx40_rsi → adx45_rsi` (avoid the misnaming trap), and updated every surface: UI header + column label + tbody id `pair-rsi-ob-adx45-rsi-body` + render + BOTH text-report exports (`_obtab` clipboard + `_obtab2` saved-file, D12 parity) + the stale config-panel footnote (now "ADX≥45 floor; raised 40→45 — 40-45 = 17/47%/−$605 loser, edge = 45+ = 17/82%/+$347"). No behavior change.

**Dig (NO SHIP) — FAN flip-short negative-gap −1.2% bleed = variance.** Operator asked what the with-trend (negative-gap) −1.2% bleeders (BTR/VELVET/EPIC) share, after gap≥1.0 only catches the counter-trend (positive) side. Profiled the post-gap-filter kept pool (58/74%/+$1,401; 15 losers): close_reason 11/15 = FLIP_STOP_LOSS straight-to-SL (−$1,102); per-pair concentration worst-2 = 38% (< the 60% blacklist gate), losses spread across singletons (HEI −130/BTR −111/MET −106/EPIC −85/XLM −74); winner-vs-loser separators all weak (pair-ATR 0.94 vs 0.81, pair-vol $89M vs $120M, BTC-ADX 30.5 vs 27.8 — faint low-vol/high-BTC-ADX tilt, not filterable at N=15); and two of the three named pairs don't hold up (VELVET net WINNER 4/75%/+$68; BTR & EPIC N=1 each). VERDICT: irreducible 20×-short straight-to-SL tail, no separable signature, no concentration → de-leverage territory (deferred scaling roadmap), NOT another entry filter. Do not re-hunt.

### 2026-06-21 — BULL-LONG → 1× OBSERVATION ARM (config) + the BTC-momentum driver dig + BOUNCE-LONG falling-knife finding

**Config change (bull-long obs arm, config.py + trading_config.json):** `bull_long_lev_mult` 1.0→0.05 (20×→1×), `bull_long_regimes` "HEALTHY_BULL"→"STRONG_BULL,HEALTHY_BULL,CHOPPY_FLAT,CHOPPY_WEAK" (bear EXCLUDED), `bull_long_fan_min` 1.65→1.35, `bull_long_fan_max` 3.0→5.0. Existing UI fields (no new D11).

**The dig (why):** operator flagged the Bull-Long Curve keeps shifting batch-to-batch and live bull-longs underperform. Pooled live BULL_LONG cross-batch (J20+J21, N=52, 50% WR, −$391, avg −0.126%) and profiled winners vs losers across every entry variable. Result: **fan bucket & regime do NOT separate** (entry RSI sep 0.00, fan sep 0.01, regime all HEALTHY_BULL anyway) — the driver is **BTC momentum/extension at entry**: (1) BTC 30m-RSI accel (btc_rsi − btc_rsi_prev6) monotonic — <+5 ~29%WR, +5-12 33%, **≥+12 = 26/73%WR/+0.149%**; (2) BTC EMA13-EMA50 gap — <+0.06 ~67%WR, **≥+0.06 = 22/27%WR/−$430 (the entire net loss)**. 2D good cell (Δrsi≥5 & gap<0.06) = 29/69%/+$44 vs REST 23/26%/−$434. Mechanism: a build-side long is a momentum bet — needs BTC accelerating UP with headroom; fails when BTC mildly-rising-but-stretched (20/26 losers DOA, peak <+0.20%). The Bull-Long Curve (fan×regime flat phantom) is structurally blind to this → that's the instability. CAVEAT: N=52 is ~90% from J20 (single-batch; BULL_LONG only exists since Jun 20) → NOT ship-ready; converted to a 1× obs arm to confirm on fresh batches. **2 TRACKING GATES: ① BTC gap≥+0.06 ≤40% WR → ship `bull_long_btc_gap_max≈0.06`; ② BTC 30m-RSI Δ≥+12 ≥65% WR → make it the entry condition.** Both split ×regime to test whether the pattern is regime-invariant (the actual experiment behind broadening regimes). Bear excluded because build-side long-into-bear is the opposite thesis (flip-LONG bear evidence = 2/0%WR/−$220). Fan widened back to 1.35-5.0 because fan is a suspected red herring — open the aperture and let the tracked BTC cells reveal the gate. REVERT: any single bull-long gaps past ~−1.0% OR the arm <40% WR at N≥20 → cut back to HEALTHY_BULL / fan 1.65-3.0 / lev 0.05.

**BOUNCE-LONG falling-knife finding (no config change):** operator asked to apply the same widen-regimes idea to bounce-long. First checked: it had ZERO live fires across J17-J21 (rare trigger btc_rsi≤35 + HEALTHY_BEAR gate). Then the 21:00 batch produced the first 2 live BOUNCE_LONG (NEAR, JTO) — BOTH LOST (−0.71%/−0.69%, straight-to-SL, DOA peak ≤0.08%). Both fired mid-crash: BTC 30m-RSI Δ = −18.5 (NEAR) and −25.5 (JTO) — still plunging hard = FALLING KNIVES. This is the MIRROR of bull-long: bounce-long is a mean-reversion bet that needs the down-move EXHAUSTING (BTC 30m-RSI recovering/decelerating), NOT just oversold. The current oversold-cell gate catches "low RSI" but not "RSI turning." DECISION: do NOT widen bounce_long_regimes (STRONG_BEAR would catch MORE falling knives); the real lever is an exhaustion/turn gate (don't fire while BTC 30m-RSI Δ deeply negative). Kept HEALTHY_BEAR + 1×; watchlist the exhaustion variable. Unifying insight: BTC 30m-RSI momentum is the master variable for BOTH long sleeves — bull-long rides positive acceleration (Δ≥+12), bounce-long must avoid negative acceleration (don't catch the down-spike).

### 2026-06-22 — SHIP: PAIR_RSI_OB pair-gap≥1.0 block + SYN blacklist + BULL_LONG fan-min 1.35→1.0

**Context — PAIR_RSI_OB was the batch's big drainer.** Latest paper batch (CSV 03-26-00): the PAIR_RSI_OB overbought-fade SHORT sleeve = N=22, 41% WR, −0.38% avg, **−$982.88** (all in STRONG_BULL; the entire bullish-section short book IS this sleeve, so every short split = a clean cut of it). Operator asked: is there a single entry variable that divides winners from losers?

**The dig (per-trade CSV, winners included — not bucket aggregates).** ① **Per-pair concentration:** EIGEN (8, 3W/5L, −$521) + SYN (5, 0W/5L, −$424) = **96% of the loss** → trips the locked "≥60% in 1-2 pairs → pair treatment, not dimension filter" rule. ② **Cleanest dimension = pair EMA13-EMA50 gap:** gap<1.0 = 3/100%/+$97 vs gap≥1.0 = 19/32%/−$1,080; ALL 13 losers have gap≥1.148 → gap≥1.0 catches 100% of losers. ③ **EIGEN is dimension-inseparable:** its 3 winners and 5 losers fully overlap on gap/ATR/RSI/RngPos/stretch/pADX; the ONLY separator is peak_pnl (winners armed peak≥0.78, losers gap-down peak≤0.41) = an OUTCOME, not an entry input. The big non-EIGEN winners (PUMP+$77/WLD+$95/ALLO+$31) sit at the SAME high gap as losers → no extension filter can spare them. ④ **Alternatives are worse:** ATR≥0.85 misses 3 low-ATR losers (−$336); RngPos 85-95 & RSI≥85 catch only subsets. ⑤ **Exit-tightening REJECTED:** fast-exit 0.20%/2min CF = +$502 but fires on 5 trades, 4 of them SYN (Real −$436 matches exactly) → REDUNDANT with the SYN block; after SYN it saves only EIGEN −127 (~+$140), leaving −$421. The 7 non-SYN immediate-gap losers (peak<0.20, −$759) can't be exit-saved — entry block is the only lever. Lowering the arm threshold alone barely helps (the +0.10 min-profit gate still rides the SL for sub-0.30 pokes).

**SHIP 1 — `flip_pair_rsi_ob_pair_gap_max=1.0` (new field, full D11).** Block PAIR_RSI_OB flip-SHORT when pair (EMA13−EMA50)/EMA50% ≥ 1.0. PAIR_RSI_OB RETURNS EARLY in `_flip_filters` (so it doesn't inherit FAN's regime gates) → it never saw the universal `flip_short_pair_gap_max` block; this replicates that block inside the PAIR_RSI_OB branch on its OWN field (independent revert clock from FAN). Impact (in-sample): blocks 19/22 (13 losers + 6 inseparable winners), keeps 3 clean low-gap winners (DOT/AVAX/BTC) → cohort **−$983 → +$97**. Cost = 6 forfeited winners (+$288), and the sleeve shrinks to ~14% pass — near-shutting it in S.BULL, acceptable since it's net-losing there. DISCIPLINE-OVERRIDE: N=22 < N≥30, one window — justified because it MIRRORS the cross-batch-validated FAN gap≥1.0 filter (N=16, J17-21, identical anti-parabola mechanism), so it extends a proven gate to the sister source, not a fresh fit. Engine gate in PAIR_RSI_OB branch (counter `FLIP_PAIR_RSI_OB_GAP`, auto-recorded via the line-3229 flip-block path; `pair_gap` already in `_ff_in` from the 06-21 FAN ship). D11: config.py default 1.0 + evidence comment, trading_config.json 1.0, engine gate, templates UI input `config-flip-pair-rsi-ob-pair-gap-max` + _setVal load + save payload. **TIGHT REVERT: `flip_pair_rsi_ob_pair_gap_max`→0 if blocked (gap≥1.0) PAIR_RSI_OB fades show ≥50% WR on N≥10 fresh.**

**SHIP 2 — SYN → pair_blacklist.** SYNUSDT added to `pair_blacklist` (0W/5L this batch, gap ~9-11%, ATR ~3%). NOTE: redundant with Ship 1 on this data (SYN gap ~10 already caught by gap≥1.0); kept as belt-and-suspenders (catches SYN if it ever fires at gap<1.0 in any sleeve) and operator-directed. N=5 single-batch = below the evidence bar → the weaker of the two; re-whitelist if it doesn't repeat as a loser. Global block (whole universe), acceptable since the bot is ~flip-only and SYN is a high-ATR meme.

**SHIP 3 — BULL_LONG `bull_long_fan_min` 1.35→1.0 (config-only, operator-directed).** Widens the 1× observation arm's lower fan bound to 1.0 (fan 1.0-5.0; fan_max stays 5.0, lev stays 0.05/1×). NOTE the opened 1.0-1.35 band is a documented 20× LOSER (06-20: 14/36%WR/−$732) — opened ONLY because the arm runs at 1×/0.05-lev observation (data collection, not sizing). Consistent with the 06-21 "fan is a suspected red herring; track BTC-momentum instead" reframe. REVERT unchanged: any single bull-long gaps past ~−1.0% OR arm <40% WR at N≥20 → cut back.

All three are staged together this commit. py+json AST clean.

### 2026-06-22 — RETIRE-TO-OBSERVATION: PAIR_RSI_OB de-levered 20×→1× (Option B)

`flip_entry_sources` `PAIR_RSI_OB:1.0:1.0` → **`PAIR_RSI_OB:1.0:0.05`** (size 1× unchanged; lev 1.0→0.05 = 20×→~1× actual). After the gap≥1.0 ship cut the parabola tail, the operator asked to dig the post-filter survivors for a winner/loser separator; the dig was thorough and CROSS-BATCH NEGATIVE, so we retired the sleeve to observation rather than keep hunting.

**Why (the full exhaustion case):** PAIR_RSI_OB is a counter-trend overbought-fade SHORT in STRONG_BULL at 20×. It has FAILED its locked source-revert gate (WR≤55% OR avg≤+0.05% at N≥20) by a wide margin — live 33/42%WR/−0.32%avg, deduped cross-batch N=136 net-negative. Every entry/exit lever was tested cross-batch and none yields a stable positive cohort: ① gap≥1.0 — REAL and KEPT (removed the −$1,080 high-gap parabola tail, also the FAN-short filter) but the residual gap<1.0 cohort (N=76) is still net-neg (−$292 at ATR≥0.25); ② pADX≥45 floor decayed (9/89%→13/62%→neg); ③ RSI buckets all neg live (65-70 −$319, 75-80 −$260, 85-90 −$445); ④ regime already S.BULL-gated; ⑤ ATR — a FLOOR at 0.25 INVERTS cross-batch (06-18 low 50% vs high 25%, 06-21 low 100% vs high 75%, clean only 06-22), and the better-defined ATR WINDOW 0.25-0.50 (gap<1.0 cohort = the only positive band, 29/~48%/+$55) is marginal + today-heavy; ⑥ exit — fast-TP only rescues the already-blocked SYN (residual losers are DOA/never-armed). Mechanism diagnosis = ~zero-edge fat-tailed coin flip (same as FAN-flip-short); the only constant across all 6 batches is the 20× gap-through-SL + broken R:R (wins +0.2-0.5% vs losses full −0.7 to −1.2%), which makes ~45% WR net-negative by construction. No entry variable can rescue a cohort whose loser-defining trait (did it arm) is an OUTCOME unseeable at entry.

**Why Option B (de-lever to 1× obs) not A (disable):** operator chose to keep it firing live at 1× so live+phantom data keeps accruing (caps the bleed at ~1× instead of 20×) rather than full phantom-only. **RE-LEVER only on a cross-batch-STABLE (≥3 batch) winner/loser separator — explicitly NOT another in-sample finding.** KEPT: the gap≥1.0 filter, the pADX≥45/regime gates (harmless at 1×), all PAIR_RSI_OB analytics tables, and the ATR-window watchlist (next-batch re-check). Config-only (existing `flip_entry_sources` field); CURRENT_STATE PAIR_RSI_OB line updated with the de-lever + re-lever gate.

## 2026-06-22 — BULL-LONG: narrow live aperture (fan_max 5.0→2.0) + drop CHOP regimes + S/H/o analytics column
**Context:** 06-22 batch (N=32 bull-longs @1×/0.05-lev observation). Both 06-21 BTC-momentum tracking gates FAILED/INVERTED on fresh data (gap≥+0.06 "loser" → 4/100%/+0.745%; 30m-RSI Δ≥+12 "winner" → 11/55%/−0.135%) → N=52 dig was single-batch overfit; neither ships. The recurring (but confound-flagged) shape: regime > fan.

**Live realized (avg% lev-invariant):**
- S+H BULL = 14/64%/+0.155% (S.BULL 7/57%/+0.20, H.BULL 7/71%/+0.11) · CHOP = 18/56%/−0.247%/−$482 de-mux (>½ sleeve volume = the whole drain).
- Fan: 1.0-1.35 5/60%/−$96 · 1.35-1.65 8/75%/+$95 · 1.65-2.0 8/75%/+$305 · 2.0-3.0 9/33%/−$452 · 3.0-5.0 2/50%/−$100. Tighter: S+H BULL fan 1-3 = 13/69%/+0.262% · fan 1-2 = 10/80%/+0.422%.

**Changes (operator-directed, config-only — existing UI fields):**
1. `bull_long_fan_max` 5.0→**2.0** — narrow LIVE aperture to fan 1.0-2.0 (current best-belief band; fan>2 gives bull-regime wins back this batch). ⚠ IN-SAMPLE: fan 2-3 was the 06-20 WINNER (10/90%/+$705) → INVERTS cross-batch. Safe only because (a) obs-lev 0.05×, (b) phantom Bull-Long Curve still tracks fan 2-5 regardless of live config.
2. `bull_long_regimes` STRONG_BULL,HEALTHY_BULL,CHOPPY_FLAT,CHOPPY_WEAK→**STRONG_BULL,HEALTHY_BULL** — drop CHOP (the whole live drain). Bull regimes alone are +0.155%.
3. **Analytics:** new `S/H/o` column on the 🐂 Bull-Long × Fan Bucket table = per-bucket entry-count split S.BULL/H.BULL/other (other=CHOP+bear), reconciles to N. Server `_compute_bull_long_trades` adds sbull_n/hbull_n/other_n via existing `_rb()` (zero new Order columns). D12: UI table + BOTH text exports (grep-verified: FAN BUCKET ×2 exports, S/H/o ×3 surfaces).

**Framing:** NOT a hard rule / not a re-lever. Stays at 0.05× observation. Companion CURRENT_STATE "🔭 OBSERVATION-FOR-REVIEW" note records the future-review trigger: IF S+H BULL fan ≤2.0 reaches N≥30 cumulative across ≥2 batches holding WR≥70%/avg≥+0.15% → THEN consider re-lever. Until then keep collecting.
**Files:** config.py, trading_config.json, main.py, templates/index.html, CLAUDE_CURRENT_STATE.md.

## 2026-06-22 — FAN flip multiplier DROPPED: strong-bear 2× cell → 1×
**Change:** `flip_fan_mult_rule` `"40-45:35-99:2.0:1.0"` → **`"40-45:35-99:1.0:1.0"`** (BTC RSI 40-45 × BTC ADX≥35 strong-bear cell; size 2.0→1.0). config.py + trading_config.json + CLAUDE_CURRENT_STATE.md (FAN-flip line ④).
**Why:** First fresh live fire was ✗ — EIGENUSDT SHORT −1.206% / **−$209.02** (the batch's worst loss); the 2× doubled a −$104.51 1× baseline loss. The trade peaked **+0.166%**, which FAILS the locked **2× BE-compatibility gate** (≥60% of a cell's losses must peak ≥+0.20% so caps can bound the tail) → caps structurally couldn't bound it, which is exactly why 2× hurt. Cell was already a below-N≥30 discipline override. Multiplying a fade-short amplifies the gap-through-SL tail = the realized risk.
**Discipline note:** Formal multiplier verdict gate is ≥5 fresh fires (we're at N=1), so not a formal "✗ HARMFUL" call — but de-levering a loser is the asymmetric always-allowed side, AND the BE-compat gate is independently failed regardless of N. The FAN_RATIO_GATE flip itself stays 1× (validated winner, +$548 this batch) — only the amplifier is removed.
**Re-earn gate:** restore a multiplier only at N≥5 fresh fires + Total$>0 + BE-compatibility (≥60% of losses peak ≥+0.20%). Existing UI field (Invest Multi) — no new D11 wiring.

## 2026-06-22 — BULL-LONG RE-LEVERED 1×→20× + band restricted to fan 1.35-2.0 (operator discipline-override, fresh-reset test)
**Change:** `bull_long_lev_mult` 0.05→**1.0** (1×→20×), `bull_long_fan_min` 1.0→**1.35** (fan_max=2.0, regimes=STRONG_BULL,HEALTHY_BULL unchanged). Live cell = **S+H BULL × fan 1.35-2.0 @ 20×**. config.py + trading_config.json + CLAUDE_CURRENT_STATE.md. Operator will RESET paper + start a fresh batch on this config.
**Evidence (06-22, bull-only fan 1.35-2.0):** 8/88%WR/+0.554% avg — the in-band sweet spot (fan<1.35 = 5/60%/−$96; fan>2 = SL losers; CHOP half of the band = −0.091%, excluded by the regime gate).
**⚠️ DISCIPLINE-OVERRIDE — acknowledged transparently:** N=8 bull-only < the locked N≥30 multiplier/re-lever gate, AND 0.05→1.0 is a 20× jump that skips the mandated 1.5×-first staging. Same override profile as the PAIR_RSI_OB / earlier BULL_LONG 20× ships. Analyst recommendation was HOLD at 1× for one more session then ship 1.5× first; operator chose 20× now. Justification accepted: a FRESH RESET gives clean single-config attribution (the cleanest possible test surface), and the in-band edge is strong this batch.
**Cross-batch risk:** bull-long sub-bands have demonstrably inverted (fan 2-3 = 10/90%/+$705 on 06-20 → 9/33%/−$452 on 06-22). 88%/N=8 may regress. 20× build-side long carries gap-through-SL exposure on the ruin axis.
**TIGHT REVERT (tighter-than-standard per override rule):** de-lever `bull_long_lev_mult`→0.05 at live N≥10 NEW bull-longs if fan 1.35-2.0 S+H-bull WR≤70% OR avg≤+0.15%; INSTANT de-lever if 3 of first 6 hit SL OR any single bull-long gaps past ~−1.0%. Existing UI fields — no new D11.

## 2026-06-22 — Blacklist EIGENUSDT (structural SL-gapper insurance, operator-directed)
**Change:** `pair_blacklist` += `EIGENUSDT` (trading_config.json; now 13 pairs).
**Rationale (explicitly NOT the batch $):** EIGEN was 35% of this batch's loss (−$729.6/9 trades), BUT 8 of 9 were gap≥1.0 PAIR_RSI_OB trades the gap filter already blocks + the 9th's 2× is already dropped → re-sim under the current stack = ~−$104 go-forward. So the −$729 does NOT justify a block (already neutralized). The REAL basis: EIGEN is a structural **SL-gapper** — every loss closes ~−1.2%, blowing through the −0.70 stop by ~0.5%, INCLUDING a clean low-gap (0.28) FAN flip. That's the illiquid-meme-gapper profile the existing blacklist targets (ENA/RAVE/VVV/ESPORTS). Matters more now that bull-long is at 20× (a gap-through is a ruin-axis tail). **Caveat (acknowledged): the filter-RESISTANT evidence is N=1** (the one low-gap gap-through); the gap filter already catches EIGEN's high-gap losses. This is an insurance call, low opportunity cost (gappy alt, not a core pair), not a data-proven dimension filter. **REVERT if needed:** remove from `pair_blacklist` (no code). Existing field — no D11.

---
## 2026-06-23 — SHIP: FAN flip pair-ADX floor (flip_fan_pair_adx_min=20)
**Change:** new `flip_fan_pair_adx_min: float = 20.0`. Blocks FAN flip-SHORT when entry pair ADX < 20 (counter `FLIP_FAN_PAIR_ADX`, gate in the FAN-SHORT branch of `_flip_filters`, reads `ind['adx']`). config.py + trading_config.json + engine + UI input (`config-flip-fan-pair-adx-min`, same row format as the gap filter) + load/save. ConfigUpdate.thresholds is `Optional[Dict]` → generic, no whitelist edit.
**Mechanism:** FAN flips bypass the momentum short system's pair-ADX requirement (`Pair ADX Dir: rising` + ADX-Strong>20), so they fire weak-trend fades (pADX 15-19) with no follow-through that chop/gap the 20× SL. The floor restores what momentum already enforces — principled, not data-mined.
**Evidence — 3-batch deduped N=89** (J20 pre-reset, J22 20:28, J23 00:54 — all ran the identical FAN filter stack since 06-16):
- pADX≥20 KEEP = 42/71%WR/+$482 · pADX<20 BLOCK = 47/51%WR/−$850 (the whole drain).
- Per batch KEEP/BLOCK: J20 27/67%/+$94 vs 34/56%/−$319 · J22a 11/82%/+$399 vs 8/62%/+$24 · J22b 4/75%/−$11 vs 5/0%/−$555. KEEP>BLOCK + WR-up in all three.
- Kept cohort N=42 clears the N≥30 gate at 71% WR.
**Per-pair concentration check (PASSED):** block gross loss −$2,260 diffuse across ~17 pairs — top-1 (MET) 18%, top-2 28%, top-3 38% (well under the 60%/1-2-pair blacklist threshold → dimension filter is correct). MET decomposes: ADX<20 = 4/−$396 vs ADX≥20 = 1/+$153 (bad-condition, not bad-pair; a blacklist would wrongly kill the winner). SAND only fired <20 (all losers) → correctly cut.
**Cost acknowledged:** sacrifices the occasional sub-20-ADX winner (HU = 6/+$204 at low ADX). Diffuse loss + 3-batch consistency + mechanism outweigh it.
**TIGHT REVERT:** set `flip_fan_pair_adx_min`→0 if pADX≥20 FAN flips drop ≤60% WR on N≥15 fresh.
**Context:** chosen over a regime-conditional fast-exit (operator-rejected — fast-exit capped winners on the winning batch for only +$58 and was a weak/asymmetric lever). The pADX floor is surgical (cuts weak-trend entries, not winners broadly).
